1
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,420
Hello.
Welcome to a buzzing Santiago Burnobeau

2
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,820
for what is the biggest
game on the planet.

3
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,500
It's El Classico, it's Real Madrid against
Barcer, and this season even more

4
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,300
important than usual because Barcelo,
quite simply, have to win.

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,980
They're three points behind
Ralmdrik going into this game.

6
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,700
A win here for the Blau Granite would put

7
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,420
them level on points with Los Blancos
at the top of the league table.

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,220
Rebel Jet Do, of course, have that one
game in hand, but it's a way at Selter.

9
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,900
And they've got a few difficult games

10
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,380
coming up between now
and the end of the season.

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,180
So it's a huge opportunity

12
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,980
for Lewis Enrique's side to put real
pressure on Zidane's team

13
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:14,620
and hopefully force them into a slip up
between now and the end of the campaign.

14
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,930
What an atmosphere here

15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,570
at the Santiago Burnabel for the
second classico of the season.

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,210
These teams tied one all
in the first game at the camp.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,800
Now tonight, it's the rematch
at the Vernobe for Real Madrid.

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,120
It's caeleb nauass in gold.

19
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,660
Danny Carverhaul, nacho.

20
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,780
Ramos and Marcelo are at the back.

21
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,680
In front of them, Tony Cross,
Casamiro and Modrics.

22
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,740
And the big news is that Gareth Bale
is back in the starting 11th.

23
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,490
He's been unavailable in recent
weeks through injury.

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,660
He's back and lines up alongside
Kareem Pentamar and Cristiano Ronaldo.

25
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,540
For Barcelo coming into this game,

26
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,740
the big news was who would come
in for the suspended Neymar.

27
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,540
Well, in the end, it's Paco Alcata,

28
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,140
who Louis Enrique has chosen
to lead the line alongside Suarez.

29
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,020
And Messi will confirm the barter.
Eleven.

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,360
Right now, Terstegan between the sticks is

31
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,340
his debut in a classico
at the Santiago Bernabeau.

32
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,260
Speaking before the game, he said how
excited he was to play here this evening.

33
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,820
Jonny Alba, Utiti Pique
and Sergio Roberto.

34
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,610
In defense.

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,580
It's idiesta sekyo Busquet
and Rakatitch in midfield.

36
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:40,980
And as we mentioned, Pakwalk Kaffir
lines up alongside Suarez and Leo Messi.

37
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,860
Leo Messi, of course,
who scored 21 goals in classicos.

38
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,540
He is the leading scorer
in the history of this fixture.

39
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,900
However, he hasn't scored
against Real Madrid since 2014.

40
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,300
That's six games without a goal.

41
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,380
Messi will be desperate to get back

42
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,660
to scoring ways against
barcer's arch enemies.

43
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:10,460
He's also on 498 bastard goals, so a brace
here today would see him reach 500.

44
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,900
Well, here's SEC your guy
see a big Real Madrid fan.

45
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,680
Of course,

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,780
he's being cheered on by the
entire Santiago Bernabel.

47
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,080
The golfer wearing the famous green jacket

48
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,980
achieved his first major success
in golf winning in Augusta.

49
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,000
A huge victory for him.

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,260
And he's invited here to the
Santiago Burnobe ahead of kickoff.

51
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,020
A huge moment for him
and one he completely deserves after

52
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,180
that historic victory
in Augusta in the Masters.

53
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,060
Never before had he won
on golf's biggest stage.

54
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:09,860
And he managed to do it after a thrilling
contest with England's Justin Rose.

55
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:16,220
But from one thrilling contest to another
from golf, now back to football.

56
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,540
Back to the Santiago burnout.

57
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,980
It's the two best teams in world
football taking on each other.

58
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,900
And the two best players
in world football as well.

59
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,820
Cristiano ronaldo against messi.

60
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,400
It's Madrid against Parsa,

61
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,940
and it's a massive opportunity
for Louis Enrique's side to put real

62
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:39,500
pressure on Zidane's team
at the top of the league table.

63
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,340
Three points here for Barcer.

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,580
We're putting level
on points with Real Madrid.

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,560
And we're on the way now
at the Santiago Bernabel.

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,420
Here's Luca Madrick bringing
the ball forwards for Real Madrid.

67
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,980
Modric not playing his
best football of late.

68
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:04,540
He's certainly not in his best form
since joining Real Madrid.

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,900
It's a poor pass from circular.

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,880
Ramos out for a bastard
throw on the far side.

71
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:18,420
Bastard kicking from right to left
in this first half possession.

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,900
Back with Real Madrid.
It's picked up by Nacho.

73
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,940
Suzanne will be delighted.

74
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,300
That Nacho's fit

75
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,860
after his other two centrebacks,
both Pepe and Verona unavailable through

76
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:34,100
injury as the balls
hit long for Cristiano Ronaldo.

77
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,000
Too much on it.

78
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:44,120
And it's out of play for a Bar to throw
Luis Enrique in his final

79
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:53,140
ever classico as Barceloach,
of course, the Barcelona manager announced

80
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,880
a few weeks ago now that he'll be
leaving at the end of the season.

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,860
Here's.
Circuit Ramos.

82
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,760
Now for Real Madrid.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,280
Nearly a minute and a half played,
and it's Real Madrid who had all

84
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,460
the possessions so far as the balls
played long for Danny Carverhaul.

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,940
Turn inside.

86
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,920
Cristiano Ronaldo goes down,
calls for a penalty kick.

87
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,060
A referee unmoved.

88
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,320
It was a challenge by Samuel City.

89
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,900
Well, Christiano Ronaldo was
adamant that it was a penalty kick.

90
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,160
The referee waved his complaints away,
but you can hear that the fans here

91
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,960
at the Santiago Bernabel not too
happy with the official here's.

92
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:43,100
Casamiro all played into the path
of Marcelo, but there's too much on it.

93
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,280
Look at that incident once more.

94
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,740
Well, Christiano Ronaldo certainly
gets there ahead of Samuel.

95
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,180
And Titty.

96
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,740
There is contact from the big
center back on Ronaldo.

97
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,340
Whether there's enough to send

98
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,860
the Portuguese tumbling to the ground,
I'm not so sure.

99
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,180
I have to say, I think he
went down rather easily.

100
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,060
Here he is again.
Cristiano ronaldo.

101
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,500
And once again it's Samuel M.

102
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,900
Titsy who challenges him this time.

103
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,720
The Frenchman wins the ball and puts it

104
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:23,600
out for a throw in a throw that's

105
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,600
going to be taken by Danny Carverhal.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
Around the corner by Modric,
but it's given away.

107
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,340
And picked up by Pakwaokatha
for his first touch.

108
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,420
The ball finds its way to Suarez,
but he's given possession away.

109
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,780
It was a difficult one for him
to bring under control.

110
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,140
And it's back with Real Madrid now.

111
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,460
And Serfio Ramos crossing into the barcer.

112
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,240
Heart fellow picks it up on the far side.

113
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,980
Back with Serfio Ramos.
Now.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,900
Plays the ball long.
Looking for Danny Carverhow.

115
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,900
Once again.

116
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,860
This time the fallback wins the header
and finds Christiana Ronaldo.

117
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,580
Plays it through back into
Danny Carverhow, who's in space here.

118
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,400
His cross is cleared by Ivan Rakatic.
Rail.

119
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,260
Madrid coming straight back at Barcelona.

120
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,700
It's Madridge on the edge
of the Barcelo area.

121
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,980
Into Danny Carverhau.

122
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,340
Back to Luca Modrich.

123
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,100
The Croatians got time and space
to get his cross into the box.

124
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:21,940
And it's Ben Zamar who can't keep it in at
the far post and is out for a goal kick.

125
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,460
Time for these bastard players
to have a bit of a breather.

126
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,340
Almost four minutes on the clock,

127
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,180
and they've barely had
a touch of the ball so far.

128
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,140
The Catalan side, so we see that penalty

129
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:38,060
appeal once more, and every time you look
at it, it looks less and less like

130
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,640
there was enough contact to send
Cristiano Ronaldo falling to the ground.

131
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:50,960
There certainly was contact, but minimal
for me, not enough for a penalty kick.

132
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,140
Here's Rakatic look like he
was failed there by Casamiro.

133
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,700
The referee once again
allowing play to continue.

134
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,420
And it's bail over
to Marcello on the far side.

135
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:11,780
He slips and the ball's put out, played
by Sergio Roberto from Madrid throw.

136
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,880
On the far side,

137
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,520
Gareth Bell beaten to the
ball by Sergio Tekiabu.

138
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,460
Sketch your pardon now
with Andrea Finiesta.

139
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,380
The basket players have got
absolutely no time in possession.

140
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,140
It's an intense start to this game.

141
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,020
Real Madrid getting bodies behind the ball

142
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,140
and putting plenty of pressure
on these faster players.

143
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,700
Here's.
Jordy Albanel.

144
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,460
Inside.
Andrea Ciesta.

145
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,140
Once again, he has two
Real Madrid players around him,

146
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,620
but Andrew Sinnesa does brilliantly
well to hold on to possession.

147
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,620
Still within.
Yester, it's a lovely turn from him.

148
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,060
He tries to find Jordy Alba,
but Real Madrid eventually coming away

149
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,500
with the ball
play down the line for Cristiano Ronaldo.

150
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,580
Ronaldo turns inside.
He shoots.

151
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,260
And it's a comfortable save in the ends

152
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,500
for Terse Sagan, although the ball
sit bounced just in front of him.

153
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,280
But he got his body behind the ball.

154
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,580
The German goalkeeper, Renaldo,

155
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:21,380
did well to turn back inside
one half a yard

156
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,900
and got a good shot in with his left foot,
but a good save from Stegon.

157
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,380
What a start to this game.

158
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,140
Barter finally managing to get
their foot on the ball.

159
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,760
Here.

160
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,580
Serkia busquet in to Samuel City.

161
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:47,860
Here's Andres Iniesta gets the ball
back from Pakwell Kathar in Easter.

162
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,360
Once more spreads play out to the left.

163
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,940
It's Julie Albal with a bit
of space in front of him.

164
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,340
Julie.

165
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,820
Albert's pass was for
the run of Louis Suarez.

166
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,280
He was offside, though, and it would
be a freekick for Real Madrid.

167
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,700
Here.
Come, Madrid.

168
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,620
Well, Carol failed for a moment.

169
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,940
Thought he got in behind the bars
of defense, but the Welshman was offside.

170
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:33,680
And it's a free kick for Barcer,

171
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,860
where it's a very tight core.

172
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,940
I'm not sure he was offside.

173
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,300
In fact.

174
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,080
The flag was up early, though.

175
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,020
Gibraltar intern Leo Messi.

176
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,660
Messi picks out the City,
who crosses into the Real Madrid heart.

177
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,540
Surging forward with the ball.

178
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,100
The Jordy Alba.

179
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:04,680
He finds Suarez, who goes down under
the challenge of Sergio Serkia Ramos.

180
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,100
Lou suarez stays down, holding his chest.

181
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,040
The ball's out for a barter throat.

182
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,020
It was Casamiro who wrapped his
leg around Suarez to win the ball.

183
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,640
He did make contact with the ball.

184
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,300
Suarez back to his feet
and the ball back with Real Madrid.

185
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:55,920
It's Marcelo matcho intersection.

186
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,520
Bensomar think to front it.

187
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,520
Throw in towards Cristiano Ronaldo.

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,860
Play spread over to the right
hand side by Andresigniesta.

189
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,720
Possession with passers.
Now.

190
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:37,680
Samuel titi city inside.

191
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,820
Crossing into the Real Madrid half.

192
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,500
He finds Pakwell Kappa.

193
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,380
Ivan Rakatic spreads, plays this Leo side.

194
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,620
It's Jordy Albert back into Leo messi.

195
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,720
Four foot touch from Messi,
but he makes up for him.

196
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,600
Finds sekiro brusquet.

197
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,100
Now I'm gonna sIniesta.

198
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,200
Indiesta thinks about a shot,
strikes it with his left foot.

199
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:17,120
And it was blocked by Nacho Viesta.

200
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,420
Down the line into Georgia
alba back with Andrea.

201
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,380
The Esther, who has suffered with injuries
this season,

202
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,760
hasn't played as much as he or the bassa
fans would have liked,

203
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,860
but he's back for this one,
which is important.

204
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,900
Real opportunity for Bastard here tonight.

205
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,500
The Santiago bernabeau is Gerald E.
K slips.

206
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,860
Was almost beaten to the ball

207
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:44,560
by Karen Venter mark,
but he made up for it quickly.

208
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,460
The bastard centreback.

209
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,660
Jordy Alba crosses the ball into Suarez.

210
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,860
Suarez strikes one and it's wide
at the far post,

211
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,060
but that's the first opportunity
we've had so far in this game.

212
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,900
It was a good, clean strike
from Louis Suarez, but Nimmer on target.

213
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,020
Always dragging it wide
of Kaylon Avas's right hand post.

214
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,300
Good move from Barcelona.

215
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,700
Had lots of space.
Here.

216
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,560
Louis Suarez to get his shot away.

217
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,600
So two opportunities so far in this game.
A Christiano.

218
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,660
Ronaldo, left footed.

219
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,460
Strike straight at Terstegen.

220
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,300
And a shot from outside of the area

221
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:32,760
from Louis Suarez, which whistled
wide of Caleb Navas'righthand post.

222
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,660
Ten minutes on the clock.
Nil.

223
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,860
Nil.
The score here at the Santiago Bernard

224
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,100
between Real Madrid
and Football Club Barcelona,

225
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:50,360
but it's been an intense
start to this classico.

226
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,680
Ivan Rakatich does really well here.

227
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,820
Ivan Rakatich to hold on to
possession and find Stegan.

228
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:07,980
After building from the back,
it's, um, city into Jordy Albert.

229
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,420
Albert back to um City.

230
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,820
Got a shot from Garifel.

231
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:17,600
And there's a bit of afters
between Garifel and Jordy Albert.

232
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,620
Here's Messi.

233
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,260
Great skill from Leo Messi
to get away from Casamiro.

234
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,020
That should be a yellow card.

235
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,100
It's a really poor challenge
from Casamiro.

236
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,780
To be fair to the realm of midfielder.

237
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,480
He went over to Leo Messi immediately,
helping the Argentine to his feet.

238
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,580
And I'm sure Apologizing
just got completely done here

239
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:44,780
the Brazilian by Leo Messi,
who went one way, then the other.

240
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,020
And it was pure frustration
from Casamiro as he hated down.

241
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,060
Leo Messi conceding the freekick

242
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,460
and picking up the first
yellow card of the game.

243
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,220
Deservedly so.

244
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,460
Twelve minutes on the clock.

245
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,480
Casamiro already in the referee's book.

246
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,700
That, of course,

247
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,010
one of a number of controversial decisions
to poor back past from Gareth fail.

248
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,380
It was almost snapped up by Jordy Albert,
his pacqualcata.

249
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,530
This cross is a poor one
and it's out for a goal kick.

250
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,500
Well, I was saying that was
one of many controversial decisions

251
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,010
in that Champions League tie between
Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.

252
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,200
Casamiro, according to

253
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,460
many pundits and football fans around
the world, should have picked up a second

254
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,960
yellow card
and actually should potentially have been

255
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:44,940
sent off before Arturo Vidal
was shown a second yellow card.

256
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,010
Many believing that Casamira was pretty
lucky to stay on the field of plate.

257
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,560
Well, he's already got a yellow card

258
00:17:51,590 --> 00:18:01,720
in this game after play almost 80 minutes,
knowing that he can't be booked again.

259
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,860
Luka Modrich in possession
for Real Madrid on the halfway line.

260
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,010
Plays a long ball over the top,

261
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:15,040
looking for Gareth Bale,
who wins the header fail offside.

262
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,400
The freekick goes past his way.

263
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,760
Here's testegon

264
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,720
jr p K receiving whistles from the

265
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:59,010
Santiago Bernard Giordi Alba goes inside.

266
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,960
Lu Suarez who leaves it for Pakwaokata.

267
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,420
Now it's Leo Messi into Tokyo.

268
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:13,250
Busquetz picked up on this
near side by Amber sIniesta.

269
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,460
From city inside to busquet.

270
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:25,080
Suarez not the greatest pass,
but it's picked up by Sergio Giroberto.

271
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
Busquet

272
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,380
well after now doing what they do best,
holding on to possession,

273
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,460
frustrating the realm of players and the
fans here inside the Santiago Bernabeaus.

274
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,220
The Paul stayed long,

275
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,700
looking for Paco Alcathar, who made
a run in behind the railroad defense.

276
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,290
It was too much on the pass, though,

277
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,400
and it goes all the way

278
00:19:48,430 --> 00:20:00,740
through to Kayla Nabasi.

279
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:11,920
Finds Tessegen, who skept into PK.
Back to Jarrah.

280
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,200
PK booze and whistles from the fans here

281
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:22,530
at the Santiago Bernabel, all with
the German goalkeeper Mark Andre.

282
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:30,000
Terpegan slipped on by Suarez,
but he can't pick out Jordy Albert.

283
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,600
And it's a throw for Real Madrid.

284
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,620
Luis Enrique looking for backtoback
wins here at the Santiago Bernabeu.

285
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,080
Madrid,
his side last season picked up

286
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:58,000
that incredible four nil with it was
when Rapa Benitez was still in charge.

287
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,660
Almost getting through
to Karen Bentomar Jr.

288
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,250
PK did well at the back
just to scramble away.

289
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,290
And now it's Andres
in the Esther into a city.

290
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,810
Jordy Albert.
Good football.

291
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,050
This from Barcer.

292
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,680
Brought forward by busquet into Leo messi.

293
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,570
Leo Messi with a nice turn
in the center circle.

294
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,180
Still with Leo Messi.

295
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,740
Leo Messi tried to t up Ivan racket.

296
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,010
It's just too much on the pass.

297
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,700
It was a couple of yards in front

298
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,010
of the Croatian and he was
beaten to it by Kayla Navask.

299
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,960
Great run from Leo Messi,
who picked up the ball just inside his own

300
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,250
half and ran all the way
to the edge of the 18 yard box.

301
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,180
Here's Suarez manages to get
the ball out wide to Sergio Roberto.

302
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,780
His cross picked up by Casamiro.

303
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,980
Now it's carrying bentamar.

304
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,260
He finds Christiano And
out on a flags up vote.

305
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,090
Really good defensive work from Jerry PK
and Samuel Titty,

306
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,840
who just stepped up at the perfect moment
to play Cristiano Ronaldo.

307
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:15,570
Our side as we see a replay
now of that Leo Messi run.

308
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,980
Well, it was a brilliant run
and almost a perfect pass.

309
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,810
Really good defending by Jerry PK.

310
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,260
Very, very intelligent.

311
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:32,900
You exactly where Cristiano Ronaldo was
stepped forward at the perfect time.

312
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,810
Ford comes modricates
with the ball and he tees up.

313
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,740
Karen Bentamari strikes one early.

314
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,500
It's a comfortable savior
again for Tessagan.

315
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:45,120
The Frenchman didn't get
a lot behind it in fairness.

316
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,140
Centre and stuff is Paqual Kappa inside

317
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,260
Louis Suarez, who took
the ball first time.

318
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,880
It was a sort of half folly on the edge
of the area,

319
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,600
but he sprayed the ball
worldwide of the target.

320
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,620
It was an excellent first touch

321
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:06,020
from pakwao Cathar, who certainly is
growing in confidence in recent weeks.

322
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,180
He'll be delighted that it's him

323
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,740
who Louis Enrique has turned
to in the absence of Namar.

324
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,220
There were other options.

325
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,140
Harder to round back from injury
and was a favorite for some.

326
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:23,700
He stood in for Neymar or another
of the front three in the past.

327
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:30,240
On this occasion, though, luis Enrique
deciding to go with Paquil Kathar.

328
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,900
He's got four goals in Lago this season
so far for Football Club Barcelona.

329
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,220
Paquile Kathar.

330
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,020
Wouldn't he love to add to that tally
here at the Santiago Bernabeau?

331
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,220
And what is the biggest
game on the planet.

332
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,180
His moderates.
Now for Real Madrid.

333
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,940
Inside to Gareth Bale.

334
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,860
Quite sure what Bale was trying there.

335
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,980
Christiano Ronaldo doesn't
either from his body language.

336
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,860
He's not too impressed with that.

337
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:03,440
It was an outside of the boot cross from
Bail, but it found up certainly nobody.

338
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,080
Here comes Leo Messi.

339
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,420
Calls for casamiro.

340
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,520
And now it's Marcelo down the line

341
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,900
into Cristiano Ronaldo, who swapped
over to the Real Madrid left flank.

342
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,140
With Garethail now on the right.

343
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:34,040
Ronaldo shot could say from Terse Eggen
and hook clear by Samuel and Titty.

344
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,260
Chance maybe for Barcelona to break.

345
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,260
Now messi's down.

346
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,570
And from the close up you can see

347
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,660
that there's definitely
a problem here for the Argentine.

348
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,380
He's spitting blood
onto the field of play.

349
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,810
He was certainly caught in the face.

350
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,860
Leo Messi, I'm not sure if it's

351
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:59,400
a nosebleed or a cut inside his mouth,
but he's definitely been caught here.

352
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,080
Well, you can see there
as an elbow from Marcelo.

353
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,480
I'm sure it wasn't intentional
from the Brazilian,

354
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,540
but he catches Messi
right across the face.

355
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,000
I think it's probably a nosebleed.

356
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,920
It's pretty nasty.

357
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,570
Marcelo, I don't think,

358
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,050
is a sort of player who would
have done that intentionally.

359
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,330
It always looks worse in the slow motion.

360
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,800
In fact, Marcelo
is actually bleeding from the elbow,

361
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,160
so I think he caught
Leo Messi in the mouth.

362
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,260
Marcelo's also receiving medical attention
for a cut on his elbow,

363
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,320
probably from leo Messi's teeth
as he caught him in the mouth.

364
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,160
I'm sure Messi will be able to continue.

365
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,500
He's just receiving treatment
on the sidelines at the moment.

366
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:17,240
Though Barcer currently with ten
men on the field of play.

367
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:24,810
Suarez does well to hold up possession,
but in the end he's robbed of the ball.

368
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,570
Was picked up by Tony Cross.

369
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,500
Ball over the top from Cross.

370
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,570
Taken first time by Gareth Bao.

371
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,940
It was a really difficult attempt.

372
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,740
The ball coming over his shoulder.

373
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,800
Tried to take it first time,
made contact with the ball,

374
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:47,700
but sent it comfortably into the arms
of Marc Andre Terseagan.

375
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,720
Looks like Leo Messi is about
to come back onto the field of play.

376
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,500
Good pressure from Karen Benzamar and

377
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:06,760
says Stegan's forced to hook
the ball straight into touch.

378
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,460
This Gareth Bale gets across into the box.
It's not a good one.

379
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,360
Again, though,

380
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,220
more frustration for Cristiano Ronaldo,
who eventually applauds Gareth Bale.

381
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,320
But his body language told you he wasn't
particularly happy with the cross.

382
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:34,180
Busquettes into Andres iniesta
iniesta back into Busquet's.

383
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,260
Really tidy football.

384
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,330
Once again from Football Club Barcelona.

385
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,640
Leo Messi plays it into
space for Jordy Albert.

386
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,290
He's going to be beaten to the bull by

387
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,860
Danny Carverhaul,
who does well to find Casamiro.

388
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,520
Excellent composure
from Danny Carverhow in defense.

389
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,420
Here's Marcelo
being shadowed by Sergio Roberto.

390
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,860
Finds Christiano Renault over
and out on the edge of the area.

391
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,900
Tries a strike from distance.

392
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,140
He's annoyed of himself as he blasts it
over the crossbar and into the stands

393
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:15,000
behind Leah Missi carrying a tissue around
with him still bleeding from the mouth.

394
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,400
It really did get clattered by Marcelo

395
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,960
and Harried every time they're

396
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,810
in possession of the ball as displayed
over the top for Pakwell Cassa.

397
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,620
This time he gets in behind
the Real Madrid defense,

398
00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:02,040
but Danny Carverhaul is back once more
to win the ball back for Real Madrid.

399
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,180
Here's tony cross now.

400
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:36,440
Modrich back into cross.

401
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:44,420
Marcello, the Germany international.

402
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,290
Tony Cross once again,
who leaves it for Marcelo.

403
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,290
It's a Karen Benzamarno
a long way from goal.

404
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,260
The Frenchman as he picks out Modich.

405
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:57,400
Hamburg by Madrid,
according to the referee.

406
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,290
And it'll be a free kick for Barcelo.

407
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,960
Well, they've won five of the last
ten trips to the Santiago Bernabel.

408
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,940
Probably the most memorable victory

409
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:26,570
in recent years was
six two in Pep guardiola's.

410
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,810
First year come, Madrid

411
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:37,330
robbed of the ball by Sekio Busquez,
who's magnificent once again in defense.

412
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,020
Brilliant from the midfielder possession.

413
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,680
Back for Barcer.

414
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,800
Here's Racketitch,

415
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,090
of course, coming
in the 2008 2009 campaign.

416
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,020
The year that after one
the treble under Pep Guardiola.

417
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,400
It was a vital game as well, because

418
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,220
they were only four points ahead of
Real Madrid in the league at that stage.

419
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,540
And a victory for Real Madrid.

420
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,140
We've taken them to within a point

421
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:23,540
for Football Club Barcelona, but
Madrid were absolutely destroyed.

422
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,860
Despite taking the leads
on that night for Gonzalo Higuain.

423
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:34,290
They were beaten
six two by guardiola's Barcelot.

424
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,880
The first night, in fact, that Leo Messi
was played in that false nine role.

425
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,180
And what a successive proved to be

426
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,860
as Ramadan who are having more
success at the moment, though.

427
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,540
And it's the whites at the other end.

428
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:53,280
Garret Fail tried to turn back inside

429
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,780
Jared PK who's just telling his teammates
to calm down a little bit

430
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:02,260
as the Spain international put
the ball out for a corner kick.

431
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,860
So it's a corner for Real Madrid.

432
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:08,320
Good challenge that was by Jared PK.

433
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,380
Corner for Madrid here.

434
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,860
Plenty of bodies back for Barcer.

435
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,780
It's punched clear by Tessegen.

436
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,660
Jared PK went up for it as well.

437
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,180
Put back into the mix.

438
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,570
Nice off the post, surely.

439
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,660
Now is Casamiro,
where's the first goal of the game.

440
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,330
And it's scored by Casamiro.

441
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,860
It's his third goal of this Laga campaign.

442
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:47,680
It was an excellent cross that was
put back into the box by Marcelo.

443
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,500
The shot rebounded off the post and fell

444
00:32:53,530 --> 00:33:01,700
very kindly for Carlos Enrique Casamiro,
who slotted the ball home for the first

445
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,980
goal of the game here
at the Santiago Bernabet.

446
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:13,940
As the cross is played in christiana
Ronaldo is in an onsite position.

447
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,020
Bigger part, but it's circular.

448
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,090
Ramos, who makes contact with the ball.

449
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,420
It comes back off the post.

450
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:29,640
It's very kind for Casamiro, who just
has to put the ball into an empty net.

451
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,080
Ivan Rakatic was sliding in,
but there was nothing that he could do.

452
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,460
So Casamiro with his third goal in La Liga
of the campaign

453
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:52,020
and the first in this classico,
making it with 29 minutes on the clock.

454
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,090
Round.
Widthrid One Football Club Barcelona.

455
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:07,090
Neil from City.
Jr.

456
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:27,170
PK Jerop.

457
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,720
He came to Samuel City.

458
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,640
Leo Messi.

459
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:57,880
There was bit of white tissue in his mouth
after being clattered by Marcelo.

460
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,130
The bleeding still not stopped.

461
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,650
Here comes Jarra PK surging
forward with the ball.

462
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,100
Finds Rakatitch.

463
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,780
Now it's messy.

464
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,680
Messy's past intercepted by Marcelo,

465
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,320
now picked up by Sergio Busquets.

466
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,940
Leo Messi.

467
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,900
He's got Sergio Roberto
ahead of him instead.

468
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,920
Goes inside to Diesta.

469
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,760
Finds Jordy Albert, Danny Cava
hall momentarily on the ground.

470
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,130
It's really good pressure
from Madrid, though.

471
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,690
Just no way through for Football
Club Barcelona at the moment.

472
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,170
Messi surrounded by three
Real Madrid players.

473
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,600
And when he gets a free
kick this time, Leo Messi.

474
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,940
Dan's not happy.

475
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,480
He felt it was just good pressure

476
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,170
where it was clearly caught.

477
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,640
Leo Messi by Casamiro,
who stood right on his foot.

478
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,650
Rickett's taken short here's.

479
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,920
Samuel City.

480
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,620
Every white shirt behind
the ball for Real Madrid.

481
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,860
And the faster side at the moment,

482
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,780
finding it very difficult to cut
through this wall of white shirts.

483
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,300
Here's messi into busquet.

484
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,740
Busquetz finds racketish.

485
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,820
Great football from Pasta.
Here's Leo Messi.

486
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,860
And there's the first goal of the game

487
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,380
for Football Club Barcelona,
who equalize here

488
00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:00,340
at the Santiago Burnabeau
with an absolutely stunning team goal.

489
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,820
What a brilliant move
that was from Barcer.

490
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:10,210
Just as it looked impossible to cut
through this defensive Real Madrid size.

491
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,210
While they found a way between

492
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,060
Nesta Buskets and Leo Messi, they're just
unstoppable this bastard side sometimes.

493
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,170
It was a wonderful move.

494
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,460
Finished off in real style
by the top scorer in La Liga.

495
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,020
Watch this rakertitch into messi.

496
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,130
Brilliant touch from Messi to get
away from Danny Carverhal.

497
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,420
And a fine finish beyond.

498
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:38,130
Kayla nervous and into the back
of the net to make it round Madrid.

499
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,780
One bastard, one.

500
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,580
And game on here at the Santiago Burnout.

501
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:47,440
What a goal that was
from Football Club Barcelona.

502
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,060
Well, there you see Christiano Ronaldo's
reaction to that fine, messy strike.

503
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:04,650
Nothing he could do other than watch
on his gareth Bale now strikes one, fail.

504
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,020
And it's terrible.

505
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,940
Really gets right underneath it and blast

506
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,100
it over the crossbar
into the stands behind.

507
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,820
Some fans would have preferred
to have seen Escope, or maybe Marco.

508
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:20,620
A cento in the starting
11th for Real Madrid hit.

509
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,840
It was Bail, though,

510
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,560
who recovered from his injury and got
the nod from Zidaneid Zidane.

511
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:37,100
Long ball over the top from Terstegon,
looking for the run of Paco Al Kaffir.

512
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:41,500
Certainly something that bastard tried a
few times in this game, mixing things up.

513
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,260
It's a really poor part
of the back from Serkio Ramos.

514
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,920
Possession gifted back to bastard.

515
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:52,560
And the ball over the top for Suarez isn't
a good one from Ambassador and Esther,

516
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,690
as we see this move again, it was
Rakatiti who played it inside to Liamzi.

517
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,100
What a fine goal that is.
Excellent football.

518
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,520
From Barcelona.

519
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,690
Tony Cross.

520
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,940
Terrible pass from Tony Cross into Suarez.

521
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,780
It's not a good pass from Suarez either.

522
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,000
He was looking to pick out Messi.

523
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:40,960
And it was intercepted by Serkio Ramos,
who read that one very well.

524
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:53,280
Here's.
Marcello tony Cross.

525
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,060
Carverhel Ronaldo.

526
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:01,360
Now it's Madridge space opening up for
Luca Madridge who strikes won Goldwood.

527
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,170
It's an excellent save from Terstegen, put
back into the mix by Christiana Robbers.

528
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,020
Been swung out of play,
and it'll be a goal kick.

529
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,540
Really good strike this from Luca Modrich,

530
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:17,400
and an even better say
from Tersenegen diving to his left.

531
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,980
Well, there wasn't enough
pressure on Luca Modrich.

532
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,060
Far too much space for him to get his shot

533
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,980
away,
but it wasn't a bad effort

534
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:34,400
from the Croatian, but a very,
very good stop for Mark Ambert Estegen.

535
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,380
Well, Gareth Bale at the moment is down

536
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,900
for Real Madrid, and they may
have to make a change here.

537
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,170
Bail, perhaps force back too quickly.

538
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:58,120
He's holding his calf muscle, I think,
and it's an opportunity for Barcer to

539
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,360
have a bit of a drink and a discussion
with the manager.

540
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:15,680
Lewis Enrique chatting to
Inniest and Leo Messi.

541
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,260
Well, we're just seeing confirmation there

542
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,690
that Sekiro Ramos
certainly wasn't offside.

543
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,600
He was in line when that ball was played.

544
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,740
Over the top.

545
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,060
Ramos, his shot coming
back against the post.

546
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:42,940
And Casamiro finishing off,
as we see Leo Messi's goal.

547
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:47,260
Wonderful turn to get
beyond Danny Carverhal.

548
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,580
It's a good firsttime pass
as well from Ivan Rakatic.

549
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,740
Brilliantly.
Finished off by Leo Messi.

550
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,460
Wonderful team goal from
Football Club Barcelona.

551
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:01,040
That's how you do it, says Louis Enrique.

552
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,300
Just at the point where
Madrid had gone a goal up.

553
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,210
Got everyone back behind the ball

554
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,170
defending,
and they were looking almost impossible

555
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,060
to break down as Gareth Bale
is going off here.

556
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,900
And he's going straight down the tunnel.

557
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:27,130
This doesn't look good for the Welshman
Real Madrid.

558
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:35,540
We're going to be forced
into an early change here's.

559
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,300
Sergio Roberto.
He's up.

560
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,380
Messi not the best first touch
this time from Leah Messi.

561
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,440
And it's Karen Benson.

562
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,020
I bring it forward for Real Madrid.

563
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,740
His pass inside is for cristiano.

564
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,900
Ronaldo he's challenged by Samuel City,

565
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,900
and it could be a yellow
card for the Frenchman.

566
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,820
That's certainly what the Real Madrid
players are suggesting.

567
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,380
It's Marco Ascension.

568
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:04,920
Who's going to come on for Real Madrid
to replace Gareth Bayle?

569
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,280
And there's a challenge from Samuel M.

570
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,540
Titty when he certainly didn't
get anything on the ball.

571
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,460
It's a late challenge

572
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,540
of Christiana Ronaldo,
and it looks like it'll be a yellow card.

573
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,980
Forum Titty.

574
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,560
And a free kick for Elm Madrid.
So.

575
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,780
Two players in the referees book.

576
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:32,620
Samuel Titty, Cabasa and Casamiro
real Madrid.

577
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:39,840
And it's Garapelle who's forced off
to be replaced by Marco as Cincio

578
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:30,040
back into the goalkeeper
57% possession for Cobalt Club Barcelona.

579
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,840
Dominating these are possession
stats here at the Santiago Bernabel.

580
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,100
Here comes Suarez.

581
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,020
No foul according to the referee.

582
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,420
Now it's Messi back over the top,
looking for Suarez.

583
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,940
Back to Leo Messi.

584
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,210
Leo Messi's shot it's.

585
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,960
Just wide calm.

586
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:52,820
Navas was scrambling across his goal line.

587
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,120
Leo Messi adamant that it should have been

588
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,100
a corner kick, that the Costa Rican
got something on the ball.

589
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:04,120
The referee deciding not and handing
round madeRED a gold kick.

590
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,020
Well, no, Kayla Nava's got nowhere near

591
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:12,680
it, but it did take a deflection
off Danny Carverhal.

592
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,620
I suppose it's easy for us
to see with a couple of replays.

593
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:27,340
I have to say live,
I didn't notice that the ball

594
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:31,920
took a touch off Danny Carverhouse
leg on the way through.

595
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:40,080
Testagon with skill and a good
pass out wide intergioberto.

596
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:47,900
Who gets a better of Marcelo Sanjuam?

597
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:52,720
City keeps this one in play and finds
Zandri Siniessta

598
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,660
anista once again
over to the far side,

599
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:10,210
where it's picked up by Sergio Roberto,
where it's lived up to the spectacle.

600
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,700
This first half, without any doubt,

601
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,380
we've seen some excellent
football from both sides.

602
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,980
That bastard goal, without a doubt
the highlight of the match so far.

603
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,020
But Real Madrid have played their part two

604
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:29,500
on what's been an enthralling
contest so far.

605
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,700
They're very well organized.

606
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,780
This Madrid side under Zidane pressuring

607
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:39,620
high up the field, giving
Barcer no space or time.

608
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,700
However, Barce is showing

609
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:47,420
that they can move the ball
like no one in world football.

610
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:48,740
And even when a side.

611
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,360
Does get eleven players behind the ball,

612
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,740
they can carve out an opening, which is
exactly what they did for that Leo Messi.

613
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,780
Golf
head of One by Serkio Ramos It's back

614
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:02,180
with Real Madrid now,
and it's Marcello on the far side.

615
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,460
Marcello's ball into the box.

616
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,460
Not a good one.

617
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,400
It's brought down by Samuel City
and flicked into the path of Andrest.

618
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:18,580
Andiesta now it's Leo Messi.
Messi down the line.

619
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,500
It's a Suarez.
Bit of space here for Barcer.

620
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,120
Suarez's ball across.
It's a jordy.

621
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,580
Albert.

622
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,460
His short just wide.

623
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:28,660
Another good move from Barcelona.

624
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,460
Once again,

625
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,680
they cut open this realmdrid side at the

626
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:56,340
back there's Tony Cross into Nacho now.

627
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,400
Christiano Ronaldo.

628
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:19,080
There was certainly no offside
in the build up to that chance.

629
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,440
Casamiro for Real Madrid

630
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,460
put out a play by Ivan Rakatic.

631
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:54,540
It's gonna be a throw in for Round,
which are deep in the bars of half.

632
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:58,420
Marcelo insert Tony cross.

633
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:03,300
That's Casamiro on a yellow
card, don't forget.

634
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:09,440
Picked up a yellow for a cynical challenge
on Leo Messi after just twelve minutes.

635
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,820
Poor from Pakwell Kaffer.

636
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:14,940
Straight out of plate
and a throw in for Real Madrid.

637
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,400
Equally poor from the white so

638
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,280
in possession, gifted
straight back to Barcelo.

639
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:22,240
It's a throw in for Jordy Albert.

640
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,800
Good first touch from ASENCIO.

641
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,560
He leaves it for Luca Modrich.

642
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,540
Luca Modric.

643
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:54,100
Again, excellent challenge from Jory Alba,
who spotted the danger there.

644
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,740
It could be a chance
for Barcer to break it.

645
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,860
It's messi with Ivan Rakatic outside.

646
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:04,540
And messi cuts back inside
and it's a late challenge by Casamiro.

647
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,740
Messi suggesting that it was a cynical
one and should be a second yellow card.

648
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,210
Gerald P.
Kate saying much the same.

649
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,380
So to his Sergio Roberto.

650
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,580
Casamiro, I think,
is going to be lucky here.

651
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:19,880
This could easily have
been a second yellow.

652
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,210
Well, there's no question
that he catches Leo Messi.

653
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,340
It's not as cynical as the first one,
that's for sure.

654
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:30,800
But he stamps straight on Messi's toes.

655
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,060
Well, Luis Enrique of the same opinion

656
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:43,380
that that should have been a second
yellow cards for Casamiro.

657
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,340
Third foul of the game.

658
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:51,780
He's on the yellow cards and he's
going to have to be very careful now.

659
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,900
Rakatich plays a ball into the area.

660
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,060
Um, titty underneath it.

661
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,540
Can't win the head alone.
Mr.

662
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,820
Sensio gets something on it.

663
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:00,700
Turned back into the area
by Sergio Roberto and cleared

664
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,500
by Real Madrid, but picked
up immediately by Barcer.

665
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,440
Jordy albert iniesta.

666
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,620
Andrest iniesta.

667
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,860
Weighing up his options.

668
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:19,700
Just 30 seconds of additional time to be
played at the end of this first half.

669
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:21,380
And Barcelo have got a corner.

670
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,180
They're going to have to take it quickly.

671
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,740
We've had 46 and a half minutes,

672
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:31,580
and there'll be two two minutes
of additional time with jolie Alba was

673
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:38,360
frustrated with himself that he knew there
was a really good chance for Pastor.

674
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,740
Jr.

675
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:45,460
PK making his feelings very,
very clear to Casamiro.

676
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:49,360
A rye smile from the Brazilian.

677
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:55,380
There'll just be time for this corner
to be taken before halftime.

678
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:58,420
Yvonne Rakati with it,
since it's sailing towards the back.

679
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,580
Poster.
What a chance.

680
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,900
What?
A chance for Leo messi.

681
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:07,420
Kayla Navas came out for the ball,
didn't make contact with it.

682
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:10,210
There was Leo Messi,
but he couldn't find the target.

683
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,940
What an opportunity this was
right on the halftime whistle.

684
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,260
It's almost an open goal.

685
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:19,340
It does come to Leo Messi very,
very quickly indeed.

686
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:23,540
And in the end, that was the last
chance of the first half.

687
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,820
An entertaining first half of football
here at the Santiago Burner Ballet.

688
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,200
Finishes Real Madrid.

689
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:31,560
One barcelone.

690
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,380
Hello.
Welcome back to the Santiago Burnobel,

691
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:40,460
to the second half of this
enthralling Classic.

692
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:40,720
Oh.

693
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:44,060
Between Real Madrid
and football Club Barcelona.

694
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:50,360
What a first 45 minutes
here at the Bernabeau.

695
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,660
It was Real Madrid who scored first,

696
00:52:54,690 --> 00:53:00,380
casamiro putting the whites
one up in the first half.

697
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,740
But before halftime,

698
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:09,940
Liam Messi leveled things
with his 22nd goal in this fixture.

699
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,420
22 goals in Classicos.

700
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:18,640
He's the highest ever goal scorer

701
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,660
in these games between Rail Matrix
and Football Club Barcelona.

702
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:28,360
And that's now 30 goals
for the season for Leo Messi.

703
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,900
And not only that, it was a stunning goal

704
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:36,460
as well, putting it into a really
good team move by Real Madrid.

705
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:38,960
By Barcelona.
Pardon.

706
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,960
It was Real Madrid who probably
started the stronger.

707
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,580
They had a good few minutes
at the beginning of the game,

708
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:54,580
dominating possession,
creating goal scoring opportunities,

709
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,420
and then found the first
goal through Casamiro.

710
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:03,500
But after about 15 minutes,
it was Barcelona who completely bossed it

711
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:09,340
here in Madrid, and they well and truly
deserved the equaliser when it arrived.

712
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,210
Casimiro picked up a yellow card.

713
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,420
A bit of controversy at the end
of the first half when he could have

714
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:18,500
potentially picked up a second one
and being given a red.

715
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:24,580
However, the referee decided not to book
him a second time,

716
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:30,020
although Casamiro will have to be
very wary in this second half.

717
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:35,210
You get the feeling he won't be
let off again by this referee.

718
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,620
So we're on the way here then,

719
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,740
at the Santiago Bernabel
barcelo in the second half.

720
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:41,740
Playing from left to right,

721
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,140
Jared PK on the ball, who finds

722
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:55,980
Sergio Roberto Test two in Tilm City.

723
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,340
Here's ambulance in the Esther

724
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,420
with a first time pass out
wide into Jordy Albert.

725
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:04,210
Jordy alba surging forwards
crossing into the Real Madrid half.

726
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,880
He's caught late by Luca Modrich,
and he'll be a free kick for Bassett.

727
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:17,760
Getting a bit of a talking too
from the referee.

728
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,460
The ball through to Suarez,
cut out by Casamiro.

729
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,780
And here come Real Madrid.
It's ASENCIO on the far side.

730
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,820
He was a first time substitute,
of course, for the injured Gareth Bale.

731
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,980
ASENCIO goes out wide to Danny Carverhow.

732
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:54,940
His past put out for a corner by Jerry PK.

733
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:56,980
Good defending from jerry PK,

734
00:55:57,010 --> 00:56:00,140
who read that one very well
indeed as the ball came across.

735
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:04,620
There's always a danger of scoring an own
goal in that kind of situation as well.

736
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:08,300
But it was well judged by Jerry PK,

737
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,860
who intercepted the cross
and put it out for a corner.

738
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:20,240
So around corner, then,
it's going to be taken by Tony Cross.

739
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,860
Tony cross's corner
headed clear by Suarez.

740
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,900
Picked up by Leo Messi.

741
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:31,960
Both Real Madrid attackers into
defensive positions at the moment.

742
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,140
And Leo Messi's robbed
of the ball by Modrich.

743
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:37,760
And now it's Danny Carverhal.

744
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,280
Here's Katamiro.

745
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,560
Now it's Nacho for Real Madrid.

746
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,240
Good term by Danny Carverhel.

747
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:56,380
On the far side now it's Luca Modrich.

748
00:56:56,410 --> 00:57:00,300
This part is intercepted,
but possession still with Real Madrid.

749
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:04,640
It's picked up on this
near side by Marcello.

750
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,040
Marcello taking on Rakatitch,
finding Tony Cruz.

751
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,210
And it's a good effort.

752
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,740
And an excellent save

753
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:14,620
by Mark Andrew Tegan,
who got a very strong right hand

754
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:17,940
to the ball and put it out
for a Real Madrid corner.

755
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:21,020
And it's the German, Tony Cruz,
who goes across to take it.

756
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:25,440
Excellent save from testagon.
Marcelo's.

757
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,740
Cross into the box.

758
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,540
Headed clear by circuit busquets.

759
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:33,320
And it rolls out for a Real Madrid throw.

760
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:41,210
Leo Messi putting an end in the first half
to a recent poor run against Real Madrid.

761
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,420
He's got more goals than
anyone in this fixture.

762
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:44,860
22 now.

763
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:49,340
However, he hadn't scored
against the White since 2014.

764
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:53,800
It was a six game baron Spelt,

765
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:59,800
but he put an end to that in the first
half with a magnificent solo effort.

766
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,360
Here's Marcelo knocks it back

767
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:07,860
into Tony Cross, who puts a cross in for
Cristiano Ronaldo.

768
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,210
It was over him, though.

769
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,860
Ronaldo complaining about something,

770
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,500
suggesting it should have
been another corner.

771
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,280
I think,

772
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,820
in fact, it's going to be
a free kick for offside.

773
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,520
Ronaldo in an offside position when

774
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:28,840
that ball was floated in by Tony Cross

775
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,560
by Karen Benzamart.

776
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,940
It looks a little bit of pain here.
Sekiro Bouquet.

777
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,020
I think he's going to be okay.

778
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:51,500
He was certainly caught late by Bentomar.

779
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,940
Maybe the Frenchman lucky not
to pick up a yellow card.

780
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,960
It was a very clumsy
challenge by the Real Madrid.

781
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,880
Number nine.

782
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,400
He went right through
the back of Serfio Busquet.

783
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,360
Maybe give him the midfielder
a bit of a dead leg.

784
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,500
Ivan Rakatic picks out omciti.

785
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:15,020
Good skill from Samuel City.

786
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:18,580
He sets up Jordy Albert on the far
side for Football Club Barcelona.

787
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:19,740
Albert cuts inside,

788
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:24,780
finds Andrest in Easter in Esther back
over the top, looking for Jordy Albert.

789
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:27,760
He was offside, though.

790
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,580
The referee's whistle went late.

791
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:35,360
Not sure if the flag went up late.

792
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,700
I'm not sure he is offside.

793
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:44,160
You know, I think Marcelo may have
been playing him on this near side.

794
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,380
Well, as it stands, it's exactly the same

795
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:57,700
result that we saw at a camp
now earlier this season.

796
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:00,900
Nothing between the sides on that occasion

797
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:05,620
as they played out a one all draw
so far tonight.

798
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:08,180
It's exactly the same score line.

799
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:12,040
After Casamiro gave round, we did the lead

800
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,180
in the first half.

801
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:38,320
Was forced off, injured,
hence the introduction of Marco Arsentia.

802
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,210
Tony Cruz switching play over
to the far side, it's Danny Carver.

803
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:47,080
Howard made a good run,
but he can't keep that one in place.

804
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,400
It's a goal kick for Testegand.

805
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,860
It was wasted by the German as

806
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:01,580
Danny Carverhow picked up
possession for Real Madrid.

807
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:06,740
Can't play by Farcer at the back, though,
and brought forward now by Busquets.

808
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,900
His past doesn't quite pick out Messi,
but he has won a free kick.

809
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,180
Here.

810
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:15,660
Circo Brusquettes, which Circo Ramos
isn't at all happy with.

811
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:19,340
Really got right into
the face of the referee.

812
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,860
Remonstrating with the official.

813
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,340
I thought he was going to talk himself

814
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:28,040
into a yellow, but he's got just
a talking to from the rest.

815
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,780
Brick taken backwards by Jerry PK.

816
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:46,560
Into Terstegen.

817
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,210
It's with the German
goalkeeper once again now.

818
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,000
Samuel MTTI on the far side.

819
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,580
Marcandre Terse.

820
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:01,100
It's a good pass into Sergio Roberto

821
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,480
who just stands on the ball
and possessions back with Real Madrid.

822
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,780
It's.
Tony cross slid through for Marcelo.

823
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,620
Marcello's Cross is a good one.

824
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:14,980
It was Ben Zamari got his shot on target.

825
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,380
Tersetegan made the save.

826
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:18,500
I'm not sure how much he knew about it.

827
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:22,140
The German goalkeeper
for his positional play.

828
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,780
Once again, excellent hit.

829
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,140
Mark Andrew Tersetergen.

830
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,520
It's good buildup from Real Madrid.

831
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:31,340
A nice pass from Cruz into Marcelo.

832
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:37,180
The header from Bentamar, and well,
it's a brilliant save from Tersenegin.

833
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:43,020
Pure reflexes from the German as he got
a foot to the ball and managed to put it

834
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,400
out for a corner kick as the shot
comes in from Danny carbohauer.

835
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,720
You can tell it was close because it had

836
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:54,480
Mark Andrew Teslagen scampering across
his line and diving to his left.

837
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,980
Jerer PK tried to switch play over

838
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:09,180
to the far side, but Jordy Albert
can't keep that one in play.

839
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,700
And Ram Madrid has started his
second half very well indeed.

840
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,060
No time or space for football.

841
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,360
Club Barcelona in possession

842
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,560
and they're really struggling
to hold onto the ball at the moment.

843
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:27,020
We've seen barely nothing of Leo Messi
so far in this second half.

844
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,480
Pasta just can't get the ball

845
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,660
to the Argentine, who was so
influential in the first 45 minutes.

846
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,780
Having said that, here he is, Leo Messi,

847
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:43,600
and it's out wide now to Jordy Albert
ambulatories.

848
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:50,560
Between the two of them now.

849
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:58,340
It's Sergio, Roberto Jr.

850
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:02,280
PK trying to pick out Yvonne Rakatic.

851
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,300
Well, here's that chance again,

852
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,720
and you can just see what a magnificent
save it is from Marc Android.

853
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,960
Tersetegen

854
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:24,020
got his left foot across in front
of the ball and put it out for a corner.

855
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,580
Good play from Rakatich as
he spits it out to the left.

856
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:30,340
Gets a ball back,
and now it's Pakwalkatha.

857
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:33,460
What an opportunity there for Pakwalkatha

858
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:41,180
as he tried to poke the ball into the back
of the net with the outside of his boot.

859
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,720
Had lots of time there.

860
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:46,060
The former Valencia striker

861
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,620
Kayla Nervous did very well
in the end to make the save.

862
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:54,100
It's a freekick now for Real Madrid,
for the realm of fans and players.

863
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:57,180
Don't feel that was a foul on Leo Messi.

864
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,380
Let's see this one again.

865
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:00,260
Wow, he's clearly tripped.

866
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:01,540
No question about it.

867
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,620
Clearly tripped by Marcello.

868
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,340
And here's that chance
again for Paco Al Kaffert.

869
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:11,660
Well, he had a great opportunity
to strike it with his left foot instead.

870
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:14,340
Tried to topok it with his right

871
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:18,820
into the corner, and it was a pretty
easy save in the end for Caleb Navas.

872
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:22,040
What a chance that was.

873
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,100
Well, it's a free kick now for Bastard.

874
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:36,240
In a dangerous position, well and truly
in goalscoring range for Leo Messi.

875
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,180
Here.
He's standing over the ball.

876
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:41,210
So to is Ivan Rakatitch.

877
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,360
Looks like it will be Leo Messi to strike

878
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,780
it, and he does and sends
it over the crossbar.

879
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:50,020
Well, it wasn't even close
on that occasion from the Argentine

880
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:55,560
looking for his 31st goal
of the season, 22nd or 23rd?

881
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,140
Begu pardon.

882
01:05:56,170 --> 01:06:03,280
In classicos
and 500 for Football Club Barcelona.

883
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,740
He's teaching on the edge

884
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:13,880
of that milestone with 499
Bastard goals currently.

885
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,380
Here is Leo Messi.

886
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,980
Plays it through the middle for Suarez.

887
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,210
Well, it's a heavy touch

888
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:27,060
from Louis Suarez, which takes a ball all
the way into the goalkeeper Caleb Navas.

889
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,420
Another great opportunity for Barcer,

890
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:33,460
but for a slightly heavy touch
from Louis Suarez.

891
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:38,800
That could have been another
fantastic goalscoring opportunity.

892
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:58,420
Nacho being shadowed by Pacqual Catheter
Suarez, who's got the ball here.

893
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,180
Louis Suarez tried to play it back

894
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:03,460
into Paquil Kathy, who was
on the edge of the area.

895
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,980
And it's out for a passer corner.

896
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:09,380
Danny Carverhow with a last touch.

897
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:12,060
Well, here's that chance
we saw just a moment ago.

898
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,900
They are Messi threading it through.

899
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:19,460
And a heavy touch from Suarez takes
into their grateful arms of Caleb nerves.

900
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:22,840
The realm of goalkeeper

901
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:31,980
also have just their second
corner of the game racketish.

902
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,300
Who's going to float it in, looking
for Gerard PK, who wins the header.

903
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:39,820
It's a magnificent save from Kayla Navas.

904
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:43,420
Gerard PK thought he'd scored that.

905
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:46,300
It was a great run from PK.

906
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:50,480
Superb contact on the ball as well.

907
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,780
What a save that is from Kayla Navas
diving to his left.

908
01:07:54,810 --> 01:08:00,820
He got both hands behind it and managed
to palm the ball away to safety.

909
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:05,480
Good goalkeeping on this
occasion by Kayla Navas.

910
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,620
CRR.

911
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:13,040
PK, though, coming very close to putting
pasta in front for the first time tonight.

912
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,400
Tony Cross into Serkio Ramos.

913
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:28,740
Marcello Danny asensio picked up
by Karen bentomar into Marcelo.

914
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,280
Now, Tony.
Cross again.

915
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:36,180
He picks out the run of Danny Carverhau
on the edge of the Real Madrid area.

916
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:39,520
His cross gathered by Terse Tagin.

917
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:50,500
And it's an opportunity
for us to see once again.

918
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:53,060
That headed effort from Gerald PK.

919
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:57,460
Jumped brilliantly,
made a really good connection

920
01:08:57,490 --> 01:09:01,760
with the ball as well,
but couldn't direct into the corner,

921
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,340
which allowed Caleb Navas
to make the safe.

922
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:10,580
Here is Jr PK on the ball
when he loved to score.

923
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:14,000
Here again at the Santiago Bernabeau.

924
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:34,420
Brusquettes into Rocketitch brusquettes
once again right on the halfway line.

925
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:36,860
He picked out Om titty.

926
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:41,820
Good skill from Om Titty to get away
from Marco isencio and his past to Suarez

927
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,900
was deflected, which made it difficult
for the Uruguayan to control it.

928
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,960
And it's picked up now by Kayla Nabas.

929
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,900
Casamiro's past is a poor one.

930
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:57,940
Intercepted momentarily by Paco Alkatha,
but he couldn't keep hold of the ball.

931
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,680
And it is back with passing out here's.

932
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:14,140
Racketitch in yesterday.

933
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,980
A misplaced pass goes out of play.

934
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,700
There's nothing that Joy Albert
could do to keep that one in.

935
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,020
And it's a throw in for Real Madrid.

936
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:29,520
A wonderful atmosphere here at the
Santiago Bernabeau, as you'd imagine.

937
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:34,540
Not only is it el classico,

938
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:42,340
it's a really important el classic coat
and must win for Football Club Barcelona.

939
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:45,340
Cover not happy at the moment.

940
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:50,600
He felt he got clattered
by Louis Suarez here.

941
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,800
Both players getting a talking
to from the referee.

942
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,180
I don't think it was deliberate, was it?

943
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:14,980
Having seen the replay, suarez played
the ball while he was down on the ground.

944
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,240
Hit catch,

945
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:24,900
Carverhow, but nothing in it really,
as the balls played forward for ASENCIO.

946
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,860
Excellent goalkeeping once again

947
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,680
by Mark Andrew Testegon,
who came off his line chested.

948
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,980
The ball down magnificently.

949
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,100
Well, cool, calm and collected as always.

950
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,000
The German.

951
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,140
Here comes Danny Carverhel
now for rail mode.

952
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,020
With a bit of space to run into it's.

953
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,580
Got Madridge out wide.

954
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:46,180
Finds Modrich back to Danny Carverhalt.

955
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:50,220
It's clumsy from Karvahalt as
the ball gets away from him.

956
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,900
And it allows Bastard to hook it.

957
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,900
Clear now.

958
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,160
It's Marcelo.

959
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,560
Marcello goes on the outside,
gets his cross in.

960
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:02,980
And it's flicked to safety
by Jordy Albert.

961
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,480
Marcelo trying to get
the crowd behind them.

962
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,400
Excellent cross from Marcelo.
Really good.

963
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,560
Defended by Jordy Albert.

964
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:18,940
He had to make contact with the ball there

965
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,180
because Christiano Ronaldo made
a very good run in at the back post.

966
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:25,860
So it's a corner for Madrid.

967
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,780
Totally cross with it.

968
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,660
Once again, it's headed
to safety by Suarez.

969
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,920
At the near post.

970
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:56,020
There's Marcelo luca Madridge.

971
01:12:56,050 --> 01:13:02,180
His cross gathered by Terstegen ronaldo
has been very quiet in the second half.

972
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:05,100
We've barely mentioned it.

973
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:08,840
Neither he nor Leo Messi

974
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:13,640
have seen too much of the ball
so far in the second half.

975
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,860
Back past from Marcelo.

976
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,620
Not the best.

977
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,480
Okaylon, now that's just
decides to poof it into touch.

978
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:34,160
If you pass the substitutes
warming up on the touch line.

979
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,000
Javier Mascarano amongst them.

980
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,500
He's just returning from injury.

981
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:43,340
Javi Masarano on the bench here.

982
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:50,020
Maybe Lewis Enrique not feeling
he was quite 100% iniesta.

983
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:53,780
Lovely footwork from Andrest
iniesta racketitches.

984
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,060
Ball in.
It's cleared by Serkio Ramos.

985
01:13:56,090 --> 01:14:00,460
Now it's Leo Messi toe poked out
wide into Sergio Roberto Messi.

986
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:02,360
Once again.

987
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:08,440
He runs into Casamiro,
and it's a throw in for Parsa.

988
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,320
It says y Roberto.
Now.

989
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,140
It's Leo Messi.

990
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:31,460
It's pulled over the top.

991
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:33,980
Looking for Suarez,

992
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,840
and it's a foul by Pakwalk on Casamira
and a freekick for Real Madrid.

993
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,600
Play switched to the far
side by Real Madrid.

994
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:04,340
And it's picked up by ASENCIO.

995
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:08,940
His cross towards Christiano Ronaldo
tried the spectacular.

996
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,020
Couldn't send the overhead kick gowards,

997
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:32,500
though you see in the replay,

998
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,320
the ball actually came off.

999
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:39,420
Ronaldo's Knee is Jordy Alba,
just outside the Real Madrid area.

1000
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:46,520
His cross deflected, or blocked,
I should say, by Nacho.

1001
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,220
Spends a mark for Real Madrid.

1002
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,400
It's a good ball from him.
Into Asncio.

1003
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,860
He's got Cristiano Ronaldo in support.
Finds Ronaldo.

1004
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,460
Oh, what a miss.

1005
01:15:56,490 --> 01:16:00,800
What a miss from Cristiano Ronaldo.

1006
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,380
What an opportunity for Real Madrid.

1007
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:09,100
And Ronaldo really should
have scored, and he knows it.

1008
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:10,660
The goal was at his mercy.

1009
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,100
Hit it's.

1010
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:17,340
Excellent play by Karen Bentamar,
who sets up ASENCIO his fall across

1011
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:22,060
for Cristiano Ronaldo was just asking
to be tapped into an empty net.

1012
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:23,380
Ronaldo got it all wrong.

1013
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,220
He was leading right back
and lifted it over the crossbar.

1014
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:29,820
In fairness to the Portuguese,
the pass from ASENCIO was a little bit

1015
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,540
behind him, but it had to go backwards
to keep the Portuguese on side.

1016
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,540
At the other end,
there's a chance to Suarez.

1017
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:39,600
Oh, what a save.

1018
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,100
Well, this second half potting up now.

1019
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:44,660
Chances at both ends.

1020
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:51,420
The latest falling for Louis Suarez, whose
effort was very well saved by Kala Navas.

1021
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:53,420
What a pass this is from Andres

1022
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,780
in the Esther,
where the outside of the boot into space

1023
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,540
bounces up just in front of Suarez,
who catches it on the half volley.

1024
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:02,980
Very cleanly indeed,
and it's an excellent save.

1025
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,540
Corner kick for Barce.

1026
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:06,580
Ivan Rakatits to take it.

1027
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:10,300
No chance to take a breath here as a ball

1028
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:15,100
falls for Messi, but it
won't come down in time.

1029
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,660
It's Rakatich who wins the header.

1030
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,960
Ivan rakatitch again.

1031
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,520
It's Danny Carverhal having a great game

1032
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:29,420
for Real Madrid,
but the ball's been given away.

1033
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:34,460
Tony Cross didn't realize that he had
a passer player right behind him.

1034
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,260
No, it's Leo Messi.

1035
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:37,460
Chance for Leo Messi.

1036
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:43,800
Here his shot straight at Kayla Navas,
and it's blocked by the Costa Rican.

1037
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,120
Now they've all fired up field
towards Cristiano Ronaldo.

1038
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,300
Well, it's EndToEnd stuff here
at the Santiago Bernabette.

1039
01:17:56,330 --> 01:18:00,680
This second half took a little time

1040
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:10,100
to get started,
but the last few minutes have been

1041
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:16,420
enthralling, matching the first half,
which was excellent.

1042
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:20,540
Substitution now for Real Madrid.

1043
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,860
And it's an intelligent one, I think,

1044
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:28,920
from Zidadin Zidane Casamiro,
who's on a yellow card is making way.

1045
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,480
He's going to be replaced by Kovacic

1046
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,540
with a change two
for Football Club Barcelona.

1047
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:52,880
Pakwell Kappa has been taken off
and replaced by Andre Gomez.

1048
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:01,400
This says Giroberto Suarez.

1049
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:13,020
Yvonne rakatich pull back with Madrid.

1050
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:18,460
Modrich not a bad pass from Luca Modrich.

1051
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,360
But it's Testagon who gets there ahead

1052
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:24,380
of Christiana Ronaldo and puts the ball
out of play for a Real Madrid throw.

1053
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:28,780
Luca Modrich.
Once again to Ronaldo.

1054
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,160
Now it's a Cencio,

1055
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,460
the atmosphere building here
in the Santiago burner belt.

1056
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:46,880
Marcelo puts across in towards the back
post where Ronaldo was waiting.

1057
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:56,060
Messi into rocketitch now.

1058
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:57,260
Jerry PK.

1059
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:00,640
We find Samuel City.

1060
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,700
Tidy football from Bastard as
they build slowly from the back.

1061
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,020
Now it's with Andreagomez.

1062
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:11,820
He finds Andres sIniesta.

1063
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:20,060
Andrea Gomez drags his cross back,
but he can only pick out Nacho.

1064
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:23,920
And he clears for Real Madrid.

1065
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,900
Excellent challenge from Liam Messi,
although the ball immediately back

1066
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:35,060
with Real Madrid and saysio in space,
on the far side, Marco Essencio.

1067
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:37,020
Still with Marco Essencio,

1068
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:43,920
whose left footed strike is very
well saved by Marc Andre Testegan.

1069
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,700
Well, he went for the near post,
tried to surprise the German goalkeeper,

1070
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:58,820
but Stegan well and true
and equal to it's.

1071
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:03,940
A Belgian atmosphere here
at the Santiago Bernabel.

1072
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,580
And this is a really good
result for Real Madrid.

1073
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:10,820
In fairness, Barcelona really
need to win this one better.

1074
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,180
Put pressure on Zidane side
at the top of the table.

1075
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:16,300
Real Madrid already with a threepoint
advantage, don't forget.

1076
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:20,560
Plus that game in hand
against Delta here's.

1077
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:23,580
Messy just edging his way into the area.

1078
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:27,940
Now it's Rakatic who strikes
one left foot in a hole.

1079
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:32,020
What a goal that is by Ivan Rakatic.

1080
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:40,500
An absolute stunner to put Barcelona into
the lead here at the Santiago Bernabel.

1081
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:44,460
It's his 7th league goal of the season,

1082
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:48,820
but he won't have scored many
more important than that one.

1083
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:52,620
Ivan Rakatic rifles a left footed drive

1084
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:57,820
into the top corner beyond Caleb Navas
and into the back of the net.

1085
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,440
What a strike that is.

1086
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:07,080
Brilliant from Rakatic as
he buries it to make it.

1087
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:08,580
Real Madrid one.

1088
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:12,240
Football club Barcelona two.

1089
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:19,340
And it's a goal which momentarily
moves Barcelona level on points.

1090
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:26,060
With Real Madrid at the top of the table,
it could prove to be a huge, huge goal.

1091
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:29,940
And three massive points
for Football Club Barcelona.

1092
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,740
There's still a long way to go.

1093
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:36,300
Over 15 minutes remaining of this game.

1094
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:45,140
But Real Madrid, after taking the lead
and now staring defeat in the face,

1095
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:48,620
barcelo have managed to turn it round
here at the Santiago Bernabeau.

1096
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:55,260
And after Casamiro's goal strikes
from Messi and Ivan Rakatic.

1097
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:59,220
Make it.
Real Madrid, one, basset, two,

1098
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:02,680
with 73 minutes on the clock,

1099
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:14,440
score two stunning goals in this game.

1100
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:22,140
Two goals worthy of victory in any match.

1101
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:25,140
There's the corners
played in by Tony Cross.

1102
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:28,460
Comes out to Luca Modrich who's
going to put it back into the mix.

1103
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:32,500
It's headed clear by Jrpk.

1104
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:35,340
And it's a throw in for Real Madrid
on the far sides.

1105
01:23:35,370 --> 01:23:37,580
What's a goal that was from Ivan Rakatic.

1106
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:41,080
Such a sweet strike with his left foot.

1107
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,900
He won't have scored many better or more
important than that,

1108
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:51,840
Fernaldo has a go from the edge of the
area, and it's gathered by Tess Dagan.

1109
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,300
Momentary panic for Barcelors.

1110
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:58,140
There are a few white
shirts in space here.

1111
01:23:58,170 --> 01:24:00,180
It looked like offside to me.

1112
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:02,460
Bentamar surely in an offside position

1113
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:06,540
when he tested that one down
and played it back into Ronaldo.

1114
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:08,800
Here's Messi into the gold score.

1115
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:11,440
Ivan Rakatich.

1116
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:12,980
Here comes Leo Messi.

1117
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,260
Can't get the better of Marcelo.

1118
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:17,720
And it's back with Real Madrid Tony Cruz.

1119
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,100
And now it's Ascensio.

1120
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:23,440
He's looked good since
he came on Marco Censio.

1121
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,720
Although he gives the ball away, there

1122
01:24:50,000 --> 01:25:15,700
is Modrich Tony cross into Covisitch.

1123
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:27,460
It's nacho now.

1124
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:28,540
Marcelo.

1125
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:31,780
Real Madrid, of course,
is desperate to win La Liga.

1126
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,480
They haven't won it since 2012.

1127
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,380
Suarez can't keep it on the far side.

1128
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:46,520
It's a throw in for Nacho.

1129
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:57,100
Excellent pass from Tony Cross
into Carrie Bentamar.

1130
01:25:57,130 --> 01:26:00,180
Bentamar place the ball
into the area towards Marco.

1131
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:05,100
OCEANEs out by Jared PK.

1132
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:07,320
It's a really poor
challenge and a late one.

1133
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:10,500
Oh, it's a straight red for Circuit Ramos.

1134
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:17,420
It's a straight red card for Circuit Ramos
for a late challenge on Leo Messi.

1135
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:20,180
Well, I have to say

1136
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:25,160
it was a poor challenge,
but I never thought it was a red.

1137
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,700
Well, it's another red card

1138
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:34,700
for Serkio Ramos, who certainly
cleaned his act up in recent seasons.

1139
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:40,960
But this was something we saw over
and over again a few years back.

1140
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,860
He catches Leo Messi very, very late here.
Wow.

1141
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,800
Actually, I'll tell you what,
he goes in twofooted.

1142
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:51,860
It's a twofooted lunch.

1143
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,700
It's a stupid challenge
from Circuit Ramos.

1144
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,020
Well, that's a red card.

1145
01:26:57,050 --> 01:27:00,260
It's a twofooted lunge from Circuit Ramos.

1146
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:02,920
What was he thinking?

1147
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:08,780
It's a ridiculous challenge
from the realm of your captain.

1148
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,180
It looks worse every time you see it.

1149
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:14,940
And I think the referee's got
that one absolutely right.

1150
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,720
Well,

1151
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:24,520
sarcastic, ironic applause from Ramos
as he leaves the field of play,

1152
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:32,540
which is exactly what we saw from Neymar,
which is why he's missing this game.

1153
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:37,600
So that could be a threemonth
fan for Circuit Ramos or more.

1154
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:44,060
Well, that really changes things.

1155
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:47,720
Real Madrid with ten men

1156
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:52,440
on the verge of losing El Classico against
Bastard, and potentially without their

1157
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:56,780
captain, Serkio Ramos, for maybe
three or four out of eager games.

1158
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,260
It's put out a play by Kovacic.

1159
01:27:58,290 --> 01:28:02,520
It's a corner for Football Club Barcelona.

1160
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:09,000
And things are suddenly very, very
different here at the Santiago Bernabeau.

1161
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:13,760
And it's mainly because of this rifle
of a strike

1162
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:23,280
from Ivan Rakatitch, which turned the
tables here, which put Bastard in front.

1163
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:28,540
And after that,
Serkio Ramos literally saw red.

1164
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:33,100
He's been given his marching orders
for a twofooted lunge on Leo Messi.

1165
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:37,760
What a stupid challenge it was
from the Real Madrid captain.

1166
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:46,820
And maybe, just maybe,
the pendulum

1167
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:51,460
has swung slightly in favor of Barcelona
in terms of the league title.

1168
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:54,300
Andre Gomez gets his cross,
and it's Jerry PK.

1169
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:57,300
Fantastic save from Kayla Navas.

1170
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:59,360
An unbelievable opportunity there

1171
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:05,660
for Jerry PK to make it three
one to Football Club Barcelona.

1172
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:10,580
His shot.
Charged down by Kayla Navas.

1173
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:11,740
What chance this was.

1174
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,420
Andrea Urmist does brilliantly well.

1175
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:16,820
Plays a one two with Suarez.

1176
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:21,540
He then picks out Jerry PK,
who can't find the back of the net.

1177
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:25,260
Superb goalkeeping from Kayla Navas,
who smothered that one.

1178
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:29,600
At the other end is
Cristiano Ronaldo with a shot.

1179
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:42,780
Hummus about to come on for Real Madrid,
determined to get back into this game.

1180
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,040
And here comes Leo Messi,
where it's three against two.

1181
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:47,940
And it's Kovacic who's going to go

1182
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:51,980
straight into the book for a really
poor challenge on Messi.

1183
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,540
There's no question
that that's a yellow card.

1184
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:57,780
The Real Madrid players
complaining about it.

1185
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,460
It's a professional foul.

1186
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:01,100
He's got nowhere near the ball.

1187
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:07,000
It's a lunge on Messi,
and it's quite clearly a yellow card.

1188
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:10,100
And he stopped Football Club Barcelona

1189
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:12,540
from what was potentially
a three against two.

1190
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:16,680
It could have quite easily
been the third goal.

1191
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,780
At the other end, ronaldo was complaining.

1192
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,060
He thought this should have been a corner.

1193
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,580
And quite rightly, it should have been.

1194
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:25,820
The ball evidently coming off Jerry PK

1195
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,100
and going out for what should
have been a corner kick.

1196
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,160
The linesman missed it.

1197
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:32,460
So chitted the referee
and awarded Real Madrid.

1198
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:32,980
Bastard.

1199
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,500
The goal kick, Karen Bentamara,
has been replaced by Hammers Rodriguez.

1200
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:48,400
By the way, here comes in yesterday,
picked up by Kovacic.

1201
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:50,820
Now.
It's Marcelo.

1202
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,900
Eight and a half minutes of normal time
remaining here at the Santiago Bernabel.

1203
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:57,460
So far, so good for football.
Club Barcelona.

1204
01:30:57,490 --> 01:31:00,380
It's round trip one, Bastard two.

1205
01:31:00,410 --> 01:31:03,820
What a game.
What a game.

1206
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,720
Best classic ofer a long, long time.

1207
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,180
Real Madrid

1208
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:17,640
are also playing the remaining minutes
here with ten men after Serkio Ramos was

1209
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:20,820
set off for a twofooted
lunge on Leo Messi.

1210
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,700
Here comes Messi.

1211
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:24,100
Messi strike.

1212
01:31:24,130 --> 01:31:27,760
It's another good save by Kayla Navas.

1213
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:32,080
It's out for a Barcer throw.

1214
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:42,520
What's a result this would be for Bastard

1215
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,900
taking short.
It's picked up by Covassits, though.

1216
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,300
For Real Madrid.

1217
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:55,180
Put straight out of plate.

1218
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:57,220
There was too much pressure on him.

1219
01:31:57,250 --> 01:32:00,020
Three bastard players around him.

1220
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,500
It's a throw in taken by Sergio Roberto.

1221
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:07,840
Here's Ivan Rakatitch
very much the hero here.

1222
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,180
What a performance from Ivan Rakatitch,

1223
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:14,540
and what a goal,
which could turn out to be the winner.

1224
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:17,940
Seven minutes of normal time remaining.

1225
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:23,160
We've had 83 here
at the Santiago Burnobel.

1226
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:31,400
Real Madrid are the kings of late goals,
but they're down to ten men hit.

1227
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,620
Rakatic with the free kick.

1228
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:38,920
It's Jeroffee K who wins.

1229
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:41,220
The header at the far post.

1230
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,700
He's a chance here for a realm,
which leads to counterattack.

1231
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,600
Cristiano Ronaldo.

1232
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:46,740
He's got Marcelo outside
him and finds him.

1233
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:51,920
Marcelo's first time ball over to the far
side is going to be picked up by Hames

1234
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,360
Hamas, the substitute for Real Madrid,
coming on for Karen Bensomar.

1235
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,580
Finds Danny Carverhalli.

1236
01:32:57,610 --> 01:32:59,780
He's been absolutely everywhere.

1237
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,540
The Spain pullback,
and it's Hamas who strikes one.

1238
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:08,520
Straight into the gloves of marc
Andre Terstegen

1239
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,720
took a deflection, which actually made
things easier for Terstegan in the end.

1240
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:19,680
Took the sting out of the shot.

1241
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:42,040
And yes, they're beaten
to the ball by Luca Modrich.

1242
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:45,480
So round with your throat.

1243
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:58,820
His covisitch for Real Madrid finds
his compatriot, Luca Modrich.

1244
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,560
Now it's Hamas.

1245
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,700
To Carverhal back into Hamas.

1246
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:08,940
Rodriguez he finds Tony Cross.

1247
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,460
Cross into Marcello.

1248
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:14,300
A good field up this from football
club from Real Madrid.

1249
01:34:14,330 --> 01:34:18,160
And the ball in and is converted by Hamas.

1250
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:24,620
Well, well,
with their backs against the wall,

1251
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:29,140
real Madrid have managed with ten
men to get back into this game.

1252
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:32,620
And it's inspired the substitution

1253
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:37,420
from Zidane because it's Hames who's been
on the pitch for only a couple of minutes,

1254
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:45,020
who made the nipos run and has made it two
two hit with just five minutes remaining.

1255
01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:46,780
Would you believe it?

1256
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,100
Real Madrid with another late goal.

1257
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:59,180
And that could be decisive
in terms of the league title.

1258
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:03,260
It's played in by Marcelo
to the near post.

1259
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:08,500
And it's Hames who gets there
ahead of Serkio boost gets and on this

1260
01:35:08,530 --> 01:35:12,660
occasion, there's absolutely nothing
that Mark Angela Tersenegan can do.

1261
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:14,940
It's a really good finish from Hames.

1262
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,700
An excellent ball in from Marcelo,

1263
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:25,640
and just as it looked at
Barcelona, we're going to be on top here

1264
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:35,580
and take a big step towards potentially
winning the league of title.

1265
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,380
Real Madrid have managed to get back

1266
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:40,180
into the game with just ten
men on the field of play.

1267
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:44,100
And here comes Asncio once more.

1268
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:46,660
Marco Essentio.

1269
01:35:46,690 --> 01:35:49,340
It's cristiano Ronaldo into hames.

1270
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:53,540
Hammes crosses the ball for ASENCIO,
goes for gold himself the second time.

1271
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:57,020
And it's saved to buy Terse degen.

1272
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:59,280
What a game.

1273
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:05,140
Well, it doesn't look like being
the result that Barcelona perhaps deserve

1274
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:13,020
in this game,
but it has been such an entertaining game

1275
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:19,580
of football
best classic for quite some time.

1276
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:24,980
It's totally lived up to its billing
as the biggest game on the planet.

1277
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,680
There have been chances at both ends
for both sides,

1278
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:40,060
and Barcer now have three minutes
to try and win this match.

1279
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:42,060
A win they so desperately need.

1280
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:45,460
A win that would put them level
with Real Madrid at the top of the table,

1281
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:50,120
despite the fact that the whites
do have a game in hand.

1282
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:53,120
They've got some tricky games
coming up, though real Madrid.

1283
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:58,040
That game in hand, of course, is away at

1284
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:04,540
Seltzide, who, like Madrid, are through to
the semifinals of European competition.

1285
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,040
Seltzer through to the semis to play

1286
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:09,200
Manchester United
in the Europa League realm.

1287
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,020
Madrid, of course,

1288
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:16,040
through to the semis to play
Athletico Madrid in the Champions League.

1289
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:22,240
They've also got to play Valencia
at home, severe at home.

1290
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:25,400
Malaga away.

1291
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,100
Next game is against
Deport away from home.

1292
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:32,060
So some tough games coming up
for the whites as Marcelo tries to keep

1293
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:41,680
this one in Anthuns, but it's picked up
by two at a second faster fixture list.

1294
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:46,600
Certainly more appetizing
than Real Madrid.

1295
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:48,200
Certainly.

1296
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,220
On paper, at least, slightly easier.

1297
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:52,400
They've got Oscissuna at home next week.

1298
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,840
Then it's away against Espanol at home
to Viral, away at last, Palmas,

1299
01:37:55,870 --> 01:38:00,680
and then ending the season
with a home game against Abar.

1300
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:06,940
Here's Marco, I Sentio for Real Madrid,
taking on Jerry PK, getting a shot away as

1301
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,940
well, and it's a good
save from Terse Tegan.

1302
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:13,740
How many times have we said
that in this game, Marco?

1303
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:15,460
Osenio's cross picks out Ronaldo.

1304
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:17,580
He can't get a shot on target.

1305
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:21,660
And it's a goal kick
for football club Barcelona.

1306
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:23,960
And well, against all odds,

1307
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:26,740
it's Real Madrid who are
finishing this game on top.

1308
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:27,860
They're down to ten men.

1309
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:32,080
Don't forget,
you wouldn't know it, though.

1310
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:37,180
Rakatic inside.

1311
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:38,500
To Andres iniesta.

1312
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:41,940
Is there one final twist in this match?

1313
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:45,640
We're in the final minute of the 90th.

1314
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:51,460
Jordy alba into serkio brusquettes.

1315
01:38:51,490 --> 01:38:53,180
Not the best pass from Busquets.

1316
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:57,300
He was looking for Messi,
but it's headed down by Marcelo

1317
01:38:57,330 --> 01:39:02,920
into the path of Caylon AVAs, and picked
up now by the realm of goalkeeper.

1318
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:33,520
Going to be only two minutes of additional
time at the end of this game.

1319
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:39,740
Parcel, I'm sure, would have been
hoping for at least three or four.

1320
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:43,060
Jordy Alba tried to square it for Suarez.

1321
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:47,860
It's been robbed by Luka Modric
and his hammers.

1322
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,520
He cuts inside.
I'm gonna go miss.

1323
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:50,620
And draws the foul.

1324
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:52,020
It's a freekick for Real Madrid

1325
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:55,340
and an opportunity for them
to waste some valuable seconds.

1326
01:39:55,370 --> 01:40:00,460
And the seconds do continue to kick
away here at the Santiago Bernardo.

1327
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:04,320
We've almost had 1 minute
of additional time.

1328
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:07,740
And it looks like this goal by Hames.

1329
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,700
He makes a brilliant run to the near post.

1330
01:40:09,730 --> 01:40:13,000
He's not picked up by anyone.

1331
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:18,040
It's a really good finish as well,

1332
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,940
where it's heartbreaking for Basa,
who got back into the game,

1333
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,260
got themselves in front,
were playing against ten men,

1334
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:31,440
and we're surely thinking
that the points were in the bag.

1335
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:48,080
30 seconds remaining here
at the Santiago Bernabel.

1336
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,060
Here.
Come Barcelo.

1337
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,940
Could this be their final
attack of the game?

1338
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:56,660
It's Sergio Roberto who's
bringing it forward now.

1339
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:58,140
It's Andrea Gomez.

1340
01:40:58,170 --> 01:40:59,980
He's got Jordy Albert outside him.

1341
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,060
Here is Jordy Albert.
Leo Messi.

1342
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:05,260
Oh, he's done it.

1343
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:09,980
Leo Mercy with what could be
the last kick of the game.

1344
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,140
Buries it into the back of the net.

1345
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:17,180
It's heartbreak for Real Madrid,
but it's jubilation for Bassa.

1346
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:18,940
Well, they've done a Real Madrid.

1347
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,740
They've scored a lastminute goal.

1348
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:28,580
92 minutes are on the clock, and Bassa
have put themselves back in front.

1349
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:31,860
And it's Leo Messi with his 500th Barcer

1350
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:41,680
goal, his 23rd goal in El Classico,
and his 31st strike of the season.

1351
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:47,860
Who makes it Real Madrid to Barcer three,

1352
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:53,140
and is surely handed all three points
now to Football Club Barcelona.

1353
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:55,820
It was Sergio Roberto who burst forward.

1354
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:59,060
He found Andrea Gomez,
who did well to hold up the plate.

1355
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:02,340
His pastor, Jordy Alba, was perfect.

1356
01:42:02,370 --> 01:42:04,900
He squared it for Leo Messi,

1357
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:08,740
who just had to tuck it beyond
Caleb Navas and into the back of the net.

1358
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:13,740
It was such a wellworth move
from Football Club Barcelona.

1359
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:17,060
And it's a goal that has given football

1360
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:20,660
Club Barcelona victory here
at the Santiago Bona Belt.

1361
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:23,140
The final whistle has gone and this goal

1362
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:30,740
from Leo Messi has handed
Barcelona all three points.

1363
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:35,320
It's all square in La Liga.

1364
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:42,060
Real Madrid and Barcelona
both have 75 points.

1365
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:44,020
Madrid do have a game in hand,

1366
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:49,020
but it's a game that they could
so easily lose away at Seltzer.

1367
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:53,180
What a climax to this La Liga season.

1368
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:54,580
Highly get.

1369
01:42:54,610 --> 01:43:00,220
There's no question
that the league title is there to be won.

1370
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:05,000
After it's finished here at the Santiago,
bernabeu Rail will get two, three.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
a bad time and at that point that's like 
that's a hypothetically that's like that's

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,040
like essentially you know we talk about 
extinction level events i think in our life

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,240
in in the in the history of life on the planet 
there have been like four extinction level events

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
that's like that's another that's an 
extinction level event you know what i mean

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,800
like a super volcano on the planet 
that's an extinction level event

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,320
like a giant another giant asteroid hitting the 
planet that's an extinction level event you know

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,400
like there's a lot of stuff that like has to kind 
of go right even if you're doing all the right

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:40,000
things to kind of try to make the jump from like a 
type 1 to a type 2 civilization you know yeah it's

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,560
it's my [ __ ] it's a lot i've 
never thought about moving a star

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,400
so it's a novel idea like um like i mean like 
i said like that's one way essentially like

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,160
you essentially keep the power source with 
you right it's like going on the plane with

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,040
your batteries you know i mean i feel like you 
don't ever you just make artificial life though

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,680
so that that's the thing right 
with to some extent like um

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,400
this is what i was talking a little bit about the 
relativity of it right so let's say we're talking

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,920
about the distances between stars right maybe 
you go maybe like a 20 at the speed of light so

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,240
if you're trying to get to an object that's like 
four light years away it'll take you like 80 years

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,880
right assuming you can go that fast um the 
perception of time for the people on that ship

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,960
will be substantially less it won't feel like 80 
years to you it might only feel like 80 years you

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,880
right so like the big thing being was like you 
know when gps was the big example of it right

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,600
when they put the first gps satellites in 
orbit all of their times were wrong against

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,160
the times on the ground and it's because 
satellites move fast enough that they're

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,680
going to fall back a few split seconds 
behind with the clocks on the ground to

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,960
that's like relativistic time it basically 
that's actually how they prove that like

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,000
that part of einstein's theory about time being 
relative that was how they proved it was actually

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,400
the gps satellites so it's a very simple 
very similar idea effectively where

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,040
if you were going fast enough in a rocket ship 
yeah for us sitting at earth waiting be like man i

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,800
hope jim makes it to that you know to that star i 
won't be alive to see it but yeah that'll be cool

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,160
you know for jim it might only be like 30 
years whereas for you and i it would be 80

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,840
because his time would have slowed his 
relative time would have slowed down

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
right you know it's like it's a very 
it's a very strange thing that that

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,360
includes the process of aging all of that but 
that has its limits too because you only hit

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,760
you have your your mass is also 
correlated to your speed correct so

33
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,520
you can't it's the same reason you can't go 
with the speed of light right because it's like

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,880
you got to be massless correct exactly it'd be 
like a photon right you have to be something

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,080
that essentially that is pure energy which is why 
for us to actually defy or even reach the speed of

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,080
light you'd have to find some kind of a loophole 
right the math doesn't allow it i mean it's

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,800
a stellar like a a true hyperdrive is something 
that i think is theoretically possible

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,800
it's just like god knows how long it would be for 
something like that to happen and like the amount

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,360
of scientific hurdles you have to overcome like 
i'm a big apollo 13 guy so i always kind of think

40
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,160
about like when they had that disaster when they 
were trying to go to the moon the amount of steps

41
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,160
it took for those pilot for those astronauts to 
make their way home right if any one of those

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:54,320
steps fail they don't make it that's the end right 
honestly i don't know apollo 13. that's crazy

43
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,960
could you could you enlighten me

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,720
so so apollo 11 right that's actually the first 
man touchdown on the moon they actually reached

45
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,160
the moon and yet knee alarms strong you 
know buzz like one small step before nine

46
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,800
right everybody's height yeah 
that's 11. so apollo 13 comes up

47
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,520
people are excited we're going 
backwards it's a fake one right

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,960
well 11 the one they say that was 
filmed in the in the in the movie

49
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,080
a lot at mgm or something oh right now 
yeah no so there so 13 happens right so

50
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,120
if you haven't seen it i i i i i remember 
hollywood if you haven't seen it i highly

51
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,720
recommend the tom hanks movie i mean 
there's a couple of good movies about

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,280
but like tom hanks apollo 13. i think it is 
like the quintessential like human ingenuity

53
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,040
like i mean it's it's it's a great phenomenal 
movie it's even more phenomenal story but

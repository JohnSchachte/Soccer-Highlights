1
0:00:01,189 --> 0:00:03,440
it is the game that paralyzes the world the one

2
0:00:03,440 --> 0:00:05,660
that can decide a champion the one that

3
0:00:05,660 --> 0:00:08,179
can change the leader good evening

4
0:00:08,179 --> 0:00:10,009
all of this is the great classic of

5
0:00:10,009 --> 0:00:12,789
spanish football real madrid-fc barcelona

6
0:00:12,789 --> 0:00:16,789
two styles two teams two trenches

7
0:00:16,789 --> 0:00:20,090
but the same objective wants to win the

8
0:00:20,090 --> 0:00:22,670
championship  from league one riding the wave

9
0:00:22,670 --> 0:00:25,370
of the champions the other wanting to

10
0:00:25,370 --> 0:00:27,280
overcome the fall in the same tournament

11
0:00:27,280 --> 0:00:29,660
some of the best players in the

12
0:00:29,660 --> 0:00:31,760
world on the pitch and a

13
0:00:31,760 --> 0:00:33,829
brilliant night for the

14
0:00:33,829 --> 0:00:35,989
stars to shine at the santiago

15
0:00:35,989 --> 0:00:36,820
bernabéu stadium we

16
0:00:36,820 --> 0:00:38,780
present the team that  is going to tell about

17
0:00:38,780 --> 0:00:42,019
this game in the league tv rubén de la

18
0:00:42,019 --> 0:00:43,579
red very good hello very good night

19
0:00:43,579 --> 0:00:46,860
albert luque good night first

20
0:00:46,860 --> 0:00:48,780
reflection that his assets the same the

21
0:00:48,780 --> 0:00:52,230
head great

22
0:00:52,230 --> 0:00:54,559
game great game the league a game in the santiago bernabéu full

23
0:00:54,559 --> 0:00:57,450
atmosphere of luxury the best game that

24
0:00:57,450 --> 0:01:00,600
we can see today for me and above

25
0:01:00,600 --> 0:01:02,550
all with the importance of knowing that

26
0:01:02,550 --> 0:01:04,349
if real madrid wins they

27
0:01:04,349 --> 0:01:06,750
would practically have the league in their hands at v  Well,

28
0:01:06,750 --> 0:01:08,340
if I totally agree with Rubén, it's

29
0:01:08,340 --> 0:01:10,350
good night. I think that Madrid

30
0:01:10,350 --> 0:01:12,570
can sentence the league. I think that on the

31
0:01:12,570 --> 0:01:14,670
part of Barça we are going to see the best

32
0:01:14,670 --> 0:01:18,240
version of FC.Barcelona. When they

33
0:01:18,240 --> 0:01:20,520
are at the limit, it is

34
0:01:20,520 --> 0:01:22,659
when the expensive

35
0:01:22,659 --> 0:01:24,490
scenario is a  scenario that he loves

36
0:01:24,490 --> 0:01:27,549
fc barcelona he loves giving surprises

37
0:01:27,549 --> 0:01:29,979
in this stadium and I think it

38
0:01:29,979 --> 0:01:31,539
will be very difficult for madrid to win it

39
0:01:31,539 --> 0:01:33,399
fc.barcelona both teams come out onto the

40
0:01:33,399 --> 0:01:35,259
pitch very quickly

41
0:01:35,259 --> 0:01:37,539
proper names of whoever expected him to

42
0:01:37,539 --> 0:01:39,100
shine today  the bernabéu

43
0:01:39,100 --> 0:01:41,140
well it is clear that cristiano ronaldo is

44
0:01:41,140 --> 0:01:43,630
the benchmark for real madrid

45
0:01:43,630 --> 0:01:47,229
especially the goalscoring aspect but well I

46
0:01:47,229 --> 0:01:48,900
hope

47
0:01:48,900 --> 0:01:52,509
we will see an important game in which

48
0:01:52,509 --> 0:01:56,700
the midfield is to play

49
0:01:56,700 --> 0:01:58,870
the important part

50
0:01:58,870 --> 0:02:01,150
with luka modric who dominates

51
0:02:01,150 --> 0:02:02,580
the game

52
0:02:02,580 --> 0:02:05,610
yes from the usual barça of

53
0:02:05,610 --> 0:02:08,190
all in an offensive facet

54
0:02:08,190 --> 0:02:10,590
we are going to expect great and from time to

55
0:02:10,590 --> 0:02:12,520
time it may be

56
0:02:12,520 --> 0:02:15,190
lately he is not appearing in his

57
0:02:15,190 --> 0:02:18,130
best mom  ent but in these stadiums right

58
0:02:18,130 --> 0:02:21,040
now dad

59
0:02:21,040 --> 0:02:23,140
both messi and suárez is all praise

60
0:02:23,140 --> 0:02:25,719
that barça has in attack and we will

61
0:02:25,719 --> 0:02:27,310
see if they appear in the health of the

62
0:02:27,310 --> 0:02:29,500
players of the two teams sing to

63
0:02:29,500 --> 0:02:32,230
the santiago bernabéu stadium or the anthem of

64
0:02:32,230 --> 0:02:35,980
the white team the anthem  of the centenary

65
0:02:35,980 --> 0:02:38,170
we passed the line-up of real madrid

66
0:02:38,170 --> 0:02:40,629
with rubén de la red this is the eleven of

67
0:02:40,629 --> 0:02:42,610
the white team that you record in the frame

68
0:02:42,610 --> 0:02:45,440
four behind carvajal

69
0:02:45,440 --> 0:02:47,510
lateral sergio ramos rancho couple of

70
0:02:47,510 --> 0:02:50,030
central defenders in front the anchor the axis

71
0:02:50,030 --> 0:02:51,550
of the team is casemiro

72
0:02:51,550 --> 0:02:54,290
accompanied by luka modric  and by toni

73
0:02:54,290 --> 0:02:57,530
kross above, cristiano

74
0:02:57,530 --> 0:02:59,980
ronaldo karim benzema gareth bale returns to the bbc the

75
0:02:59,980 --> 0:03:02,880
starting team of real madrid and not

76
0:03:02,880 --> 0:03:05,960
with the defense where nacho

77
0:03:05,960 --> 0:03:07,980
[Music]

78
0:03:07,980 --> 0:03:10,560
you are playing good games and being

79
0:03:10,560 --> 0:03:12,120
the starter to stop and pp are

80
0:03:12,120 --> 0:03:14,310
injured and estonia maybe there can be

81
0:03:14,310 --> 0:03:17,400
if they were fine any doubt

82
0:03:17,400 --> 0:03:17,930
but otherwise

83
0:03:17,930 --> 0:03:19,280
[Music]

84
0:03:19,280 --> 0:03:22,220
in the idea that you decide where

85
0:03:22,220 --> 0:03:25,340
gareth bale is not the best at his

86
0:03:25,340 --> 0:03:27,380
best his best  r way of life that

87
0:03:27,380 --> 0:03:29,540
vision but he has the confidence of the

88
0:03:29,540 --> 0:03:32,090
coach we review 11 of fc barcelona

89
0:03:32,090 --> 0:03:34,940
with albert luque ter stegen in

90
0:03:34,940 --> 0:03:36,950
goal sergi roberto right lane

91
0:03:36,950 --> 0:03:40,040
jordi alba in the left gerard piqué

92
0:03:40,040 --> 0:03:41,989
samuel a marmoset couple of central

93
0:03:41,989 --> 0:03:44,690
defenders sergio Busquets will be barça's beacon

94
0:03:44,690 --> 0:03:48,590
with  ivan rakitic andrés iniesta the

95
0:03:48,590 --> 0:03:50,930
attacking trio paco alcácer luís suárez free

96
0:03:50,930 --> 0:03:53,350
of the month and so for barça

97
0:03:53,350 --> 0:03:57,380
luxury defense the best defense i

98
0:03:57,380 --> 0:03:59,060
think luis enrique can jump in this

99
0:03:59,060 --> 0:04:01,310
match in midfield i

100
0:04:01,310 --> 0:04:03,200
totally agree also with Busquets rakitic

101
0:04:03,200 --> 0:04:05,840
and iniesta  I think he is the center of the

102
0:04:05,840 --> 0:04:08,150
field with a higher level than the one he has

103
0:04:08,150 --> 0:04:09,769
in this squad and above because one can

104
0:04:09,769 --> 0:04:12,680
not count on Neymar, he cannot

105
0:04:12,680 --> 0:04:16,519
play in the mls due to cancer he has

106
0:04:16,519 --> 0:04:19,339
another game to show that we are going to

107
0:04:19,339 --> 0:04:22,070
see if he is  at the level of a match like

108
0:04:22,070 --> 0:04:23,430
these

109
0:04:23,430 --> 0:04:25,500
I think it is to be a great team with a

110
0:04:25,500 --> 0:04:27,470
lot of level

111
0:04:27,470 --> 0:04:29,660
in a match like this in a match of

112
0:04:29,660 --> 0:04:31,200
this level

113
0:04:31,200 --> 0:04:34,320
at this point the person pr  otagonist

114
0:04:34,320 --> 0:04:35,910
in the prize of the match the honorary kick-off

115
0:04:35,910 --> 0:04:38,570
that

116
0:04:38,570 --> 0:04:43,980
Sergio García is going to perform the great winner a short time ago

117
0:04:43,980 --> 0:04:47,090
from Augusta's master's degree it was a

118
0:04:47,090 --> 0:04:49,770
tremendous prize for a Sergio García

119
0:04:49,770 --> 0:04:50,290
who

120
0:04:50,290 --> 0:04:52,150

121
0:04:52,150 --> 0:04:56,300

122
0:04:56,300 --> 0:04:59,449

football a lot, good good people,

124
0:05:02,030 --> 0:05:04,340
I have deserved this kick-off

125
0:05:04,340 --> 0:05:08,210
that so many successes accompany us in

126
0:05:08,210 --> 0:05:11,140
the Spanish goal and above all because the

127
0:05:11,140 --> 0:05:14,450
match in a Madrid-Barça that is the best that

128
0:05:14,450 --> 0:05:16,340
remains of the kick-off and we must

129
0:05:16,340 --> 0:05:17,870
also mention  to the referee who is a

130
0:05:17,870 --> 0:05:18,980
great referee el canario

131
0:05:18,980 --> 0:05:21,440
hernández hernández and to ask maybe he has gained

132
0:05:21,440 --> 0:05:23,630
a little understanding because surely

133
0:05:23,630 --> 0:05:25,860
someone will do what he makes

134
0:05:25,860 --> 0:05:29,639
his decisions in today's game that

135
0:05:29,639 --> 0:05:32,340
will start with the ball for real

136
0:05:32,340 --> 0:05:35,069
madrid that will be on the left  from their

137
0:05:35,069 --> 0:05:37,390
screens to the right

138
0:05:37,390 --> 0:05:39,720

139
0:05:39,720 --> 0:05:43,670

everything is ready for the

142
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:51,960

144
0:05:54,780 --> 0:05:59,280

147
0:06:03,990 --> 0:06:04,690
classic

148
0:06:04,690 --> 0:06:06,360

by sergio ramos yes what i had

158
0:06:25,810 --> 0:06:28,270
said about it is that barça is going to

159
0:06:28,270 --> 0:06:30,220
play a 4-3-3 in attack and it's the  system that

160
0:06:30,220 --> 0:06:32,199

is to put a little more into the midfield

0:08:01,800 --> 0:08:03,629
the white team the match and here is

198
0:08:03,629 --> 0:08:06,790
the image between christian ronaldo

199
0:08:06,790 --> 0:08:10,750
and samuel

200
0:08:10,750 --> 0:08:13,610
with both legs first with the

201
0:08:13,610 --> 0:08:15,560
right or the left very clear penalty

202
0:08:15,560 --> 0:08:18,590
in favor of  real madrid well I

203
0:08:18,590 --> 0:08:20,090
think a joke made me see myself a little and

204
0:08:20,090 --> 0:08:23,280
there is a Christian who gives him a little

205
0:08:23,280 --> 0:08:25,200
cristian Cristiano's control of

206
0:08:25,200 --> 0:08:27,210
anticipating brother and when he sees that

207
0:08:27,210 --> 0:08:28,800
the ball does not arrive he drops I think

208
0:08:28,800 --> 0:08:30,690
there is contact but not for it to fall to the

209
0:08:30,690 --> 0:08:32,409
ground

210
0:08:32,409 --> 0:08:34,529
sorry he

211
0:08:34,529 --> 0:08:36,779
put his club foot in a marmoset in the

212
0:08:36,779 --> 0:08:38,339
race against Cristiano Ronaldo how

213
0:08:38,339 --> 0:08:39,839
the team started  target of increase

214
0:08:39,839 --> 0:08:42,389
attacking the zinc and identity team

215
0:08:42,389 --> 0:08:44,068
barça lacks the ball, which is their

216
0:08:44,068 --> 0:08:46,470
work tool and they still have

217
0:08:46,470 --> 0:08:48,240
n't seen it in these first few seconds

218
0:08:48,240 --> 0:08:51,240
luka modric stuck on the lime steals

219
0:08:51,240 --> 0:08:53,370
andrés iniesta ball down

220
0:08:53,370 --> 0:08:54,749
cancer tried to get out  barça luis

221
0:08:54,749 --> 0:08:56,249
suárez on the run against the hook

222
0:08:56,249 --> 0:08:58,700
providing the madrid central defender modric

223
0:08:58,700 --> 0:09:00,740
for toni kross open to the right

224
0:09:00,740 --> 0:09:03,440
handing over to luka modric delaying

225
0:09:03,440 --> 0:09:05,220
sergio ramos' position

226
0:09:05,220 --> 0:09:07,079
barça is a bit retracted in

227
0:09:07,079 --> 0:09:08,480
these first moments

228
0:09:08,480 --> 0:09:11,310
marcelo plays with gareth bale he would

229
0:09:11,310 --> 0:09:14,220
delay sergio  Ramos- Cavero sends towards the

230
0:09:14,220 --> 0:09:16,019
sea and Carvajal heads to the right,

231
0:09:16,019 --> 0:09:25,550
delaying for Cristiano Ronaldo,

232
0:09:25,550 --> 0:09:27,470
but the one who heads because he follows the

233
0:09:27,470 --> 0:09:30,260
attack  that from real madrid luka modric danny

234
0:09:30,260 --> 0:09:31,329
carvajal

235
0:09:31,329 --> 0:09:33,100
carvajal with an adult mother and fear in the

236
0:09:33,100 --> 0:09:37,360
center

237
0:09:37,360 --> 0:09:43,720
[Applause]

238
0:09:43,720 --> 0:09:46,060
that has come out very strong, very dominant,

239
0:09:46,060 --> 0:09:48,699
generating danger at times in fc

240
0:09:48,699 --> 0:09:50,620
barcelona that does not leave his own area

241
0:09:50,620 --> 0:09:52,660
not here we have repeated it again

242
0:09:52,660 --> 0:09:53,910
first he hits him  the right leg

243
0:09:53,910 --> 0:09:56,350
arriving late is anticipated very well

244
0:09:56,350 --> 0:09:58,089
sad no ronaldo and then with the

245
0:09:58,089 --> 0:10:01,209
left for me it is a penalty and

246
0:10:01,209 --> 0:10:02,620
barça has to make some adjustments in

247
0:10:02,620 --> 0:10:05,560
this left wing to cancer has to

248
0:10:05,560 --> 0:10:07,449
be aware of carvajal more than

249
0:10:07,449 --> 0:10:09,240
carbonell

250
0:10:09,240 --> 0:10:11,010
because the madridista carrying  the rhythm

251
0:10:11,010 --> 0:10:12,089
of the game

252
0:10:12,089 --> 0:10:14,040
carbajales a real dagger down this

253
0:10:14,040 --> 0:10:15,930
right wing and he will need a

254
0:10:15,930 --> 0:10:17,550
little more help from jordi alba

255
0:10:17,550 --> 0:10:19,560
because these changes of fire are

256
0:10:19,560 --> 0:10:21,990
surprising fc barcelona a lot the ball does

257
0:10:21,990 --> 0:10:24,089
not last at all barça attacks

258
0:10:24,089 --> 0:10:25,890
real madrid marcelo  colliding with

259
0:10:25,890 --> 0:10:28,350
sergi roberto wide ball for the

260
0:10:28,350 --> 0:10:30,060
white team zinedine zidane leaves his bench

261
0:10:30,060 --> 0:10:33,029
to give instructions from the

262
0:10:33,029 --> 0:10:34,560
french coach continues  on attack

263
0:10:34,560 --> 0:10:37,050
madrid gareth bale puts his foot in sergi

264
0:10:37,050 --> 0:10:39,920
Busquets robs the azulgrana team

265
0:10:39,920 --> 0:10:42,769
for andrés iniesta iniesta than the

266
0:10:42,769 --> 0:10:44,389
stone under super intense pressure from realmadrid

267
0:10:44,389 --> 0:10:46,880
but receives the first

268
0:10:46,880 --> 0:10:49,730
ball of the game leo messi has the

269
0:10:49,730 --> 0:10:51,620
whole lane open jordi alba prefers to

270
0:10:51,620 --> 0:10:54,649
stop and deliver  for the argentinian

271
0:10:54,649 --> 0:10:56,629
and he is with leo messi barça wants to slow him down

272
0:10:59,020 --> 0:10:59,020
and

273
0:11:01,290 --> 0:11:01,290
see if barça as they are watching

274
0:11:03,910 --> 0:11:03,910
the game especially with the intensity

275
0:11:07,360 --> 0:11:07,360
that has come from real madrid what he

276
0:11:08,590 --> 0:11:08,590
wants is not to lose the ball having

277
0:11:10,540 --> 0:11:10,540
in his  his position and then look

278
0:11:14,260 --> 0:11:14,260
for attacking moves later because

279
0:11:16,420 --> 0:11:16,420
real madrid comes out the counter is coming

280
0:11:17,740 --> 0:11:17,740
benzema benzema christian's career

281
0:11:19,090 --> 0:11:19,090
christian ronaldo and gerard piqué reaches

282
0:11:22,150 --> 0:11:22,150
the portuguese christian's backheel

283
0:11:23,470 --> 0:11:23,470
can shoot with the left

284
0:11:27,490 --> 0:11:27,490
madrid's attack

285
0:11:30,240 --> 0:11:30,240
two minutes the shot  by Cristiano

286
0:11:33,480 --> 0:11:33,480
Ronaldo, very focused on this occasion, for

287
0:11:35,510 --> 0:11:35,510
sure, ter Stegen caught

288
0:11:38,010 --> 0:11:38,010
very well, Real Madrid went on the

289
0:11:39,959 --> 0:11:39,959
counterattack, gaining space  that they

290
0:11:42,480 --> 0:11:42,480
are leaving the ball behind them and

291
0:11:45,330 --> 0:11:45,330
a real madrid that has come out from the

292
0:11:46,860 --> 0:11:46,860
first minute to take the initiative in

293
0:11:48,750 --> 0:11:48,750
the game to put that pressure on portugal

294
0:11:52,080 --> 0:11:52,080
when they also have

295
0:11:53,970 --> 0:11:53,970
to play with them for the points they

296
0:11:56,790 --> 0:11:56,790
have in their favor  in the standings and

297
0:11:59,670 --> 0:11:59,670
especially on occasions i don't think

298
0:12:01,410 --> 0:12:01,410
that if madrid gets ahead

299
0:12:02,630 --> 0:12:02,630
mentally they will win a lot

300
0:12:05,190 --> 0:12:05,190
now barça attacks in the absolutely

301
0:12:07,649 --> 0:12:07,649
opposite style real madrid wants to

302
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:09,000
speed it up barça wants to guide him

303
0:12:11,410 --> 0:12:11,410
jordi plays al

304
0:12:13,320 --> 0:12:13,320
suárez

305
0:12:15,329 --> 0:12:15,329
right nacho  to cut it is not worth it and

306
0:12:17,549 --> 0:12:17,549
despite the move because the

307
0:12:19,830 --> 0:12:19,830
uruguayan had been offside

308
0:12:22,950 --> 0:12:22,950
here we are going to see him the center of jordi

309
0:12:24,900 --> 0:12:24,900
spoke to the movement of luis suárez and it

310
0:12:27,390 --> 0:12:27,390
seems to me that there is no heart our

311
0:12:28,920 --> 0:12:28,920
bouquets section is online

312
0:12:30,780 --> 0:12:30,780
and I think  how good we have seen that luis

313
0:12:34,110 --> 0:12:34,110
suárez is 'the one in legal position and first

314
0:12:37,410 --> 0:12:37,410
mistake of the linesman possession for the

315
0:12:39,960 --> 0:12:39,960
white team looks for marcelo the weak ball

316
0:12:44,510 --> 0:12:41,880
because here we will also have to see  the

317
0:12:46,280 --> 0:12:44,510
repetition in that career of the player from

318
0:12:50,000 --> 0:12:46,280
cardiff

319
0:12:51,100 --> 0:12:50,000
deep ball by marcelo in realmadrid

320
0:12:54,110 --> 0:12:51,100
mixing the game short ball long ball

321
0:12:58,240 --> 0:12:54,110
that is gareth bale's exit i like it

322
0:13:01,630 --> 0:12:56,510
now

323
0:13:02,790 --> 0:12:58,240
that no

324
0:13:07,420 --> 0:13:01,630
how nice the game is no grave

325
0:13:09,220 --> 0:13:02,790
the classic started at the height of

326
0:13:11,320 --> 0:13:07,420
what  than expected let's hope they

327
0:13:12,940 --> 0:13:09,220
continue like this for at least the

328
0:13:14,980 --> 0:13:11,320
first 45 minutes if we can enjoy

329
0:13:16,830 --> 0:13:12,940
the game as we are doing

330
0:13:20,490 --> 0:13:14,980
at the front of the area 10 hernández

331
0:13:22,230 --> 0:13:16,830
hernández

332
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:20,490
is on the ground on 1 he has not recovered the

333
0:13:28,380 --> 0:13:22,230
throw-in for the team  from luis

334
0:13:30,240 --> 0:13:24,000
enrique and there he is complaining about the hit

335
0:13:33,270 --> 0:13:26,550
luis suárez at the front of the area

336
0:13:34,980 --> 0:13:28,380
when he was trying to maneuver against carlos

337
0:13:38,010 --> 0:13:30,240
enrique casemiro he controls himself well he wants to

338
0:13:40,440 --> 0:13:33,270
turn and there it is seen that there is a contact

339
0:13:42,660 --> 0:13:34,980
that I know that javi suárez but I think

340
0:13:44,130 --> 0:13:38,010
there is casimiro anticipates  well he

341
0:13:46,500 --> 0:13:40,440
takes the ball well and well for me they were

342
0:13:48,600 --> 0:13:42,660
hernández this time it was not

343
0:13:50,370 --> 0:13:44,130
right

344
0:13:51,240 --> 0:13:46,500
[Music]

345
0:13:53,120 --> 0:13:48,600
with maximum intensity and casemiro recovers the

346
0:13:54,830 --> 0:13:50,370
ball for marcelo m  arcelo

347
0:13:58,190 --> 0:13:51,240

0:14:11,390 --> 0:14:05,330
to sergio ramos

354
0:14:13,690 --> 0:14:06,310
andalusian defense

355
0:14:15,830 --> 0:14:08,690
to win

356
0:14:17,769 --> 0:14:11,390
toni kroos o manda  he sends the ball to the german

357
0:14:21,249 --> 0:14:13,690
for luka modric i entered from the

358
0:14:23,589 --> 0:14:15,830

0:14:30,220 --> 0:14:23,589
christian

362
0:14:32,240 --> 0:14:25,420
to come back

363
0:14:33,459 --> 0:14:27,639
providential in the court that good one a

364
0:14:35,540 --> 0:14:30,220
marmoset me and barça have to be very

365
0:14:37,220 --> 0:14:32,240
aware of  Cristiano I see him very

366
0:14:38,570 --> 0:14:33,459
focused all the time looking for

367
0:14:41,089 --> 0:14:35,540
in-depth value

368
0:14:42,960 --> 0:14:37,220
and it is one of those games that Cristiano

369
0:14:45,120 --> 0:14:38,570
wants to win of all and of

370
0:14:47,310 --> 0:14:41,089
those you want to see in these last

371
0:14:49,260 --> 0:14:42,960
days more motivated and roberto for

372
0:14:52,350 --> 0:14:45,120
samuel to you and starting the game

373
0:14:53,910 --> 0:14:47,310
barça a marmoset stepping on the ball delivery

374
0:14:56,940 --> 0:14:49,260
for sergio Busquets here is the beacon

375
0:14:59,130 --> 0:14:52,350
of barça the mind for leo messi changes

376
0:15:01,710 --> 0:14:53,910
the rhythm in argentina

377
0:15:04,270 --> 0:14:56,940
to cancer  with ivan rakitic he served the

378
0:15:06,220 --> 0:14:59,130
left where he has a lot of space

379
0:15:07,990 --> 0:15:01,710
jordi alba leo messi in the front he loses

380
0:15:10,810 --> 0:15:04,270
control a little bit but he

381
0:15:12,130 --> 0:15:06,220
can touch it for Busquets search he doesn't

382
0:15:14,260 --> 0:15:07,990
even threaten to look for the

383
0:15:15,700 --> 0:15:10,810
preferred shot for andrés iniesta iniesta's shot

384
0:15:17,680 --> 0:15:12,130
capo nacho kick off  band

385
0:15:20,410 --> 0:15:14,260
for barça these six players who

386
0:15:22,840 --> 0:15:15,700
are intimidated by the departure of real

387
0:15:25,540 --> 0:15:17,680
madrid it

388
0:15:26,710 --> 0:15:20,410
is clear that iniesta and leo messi are

389
0:15:28,600 --> 0:15:22,840
the players with the most personality they are

390
0:15:30,880 --> 0:15:25,540
the players who want the ball who

391
0:15:32,290 --> 0:15:26,710
are having the most daring delivery

392
0:15:36,830 --> 0:15:28,600
we have seen other players who

393
0:15:38,210 --> 0:15:30,880
prefer to keep that  ball play

394
0:15:41,270 --> 0:15:32,290
safer play backwards from there fc

395
0:15:44,810 --> 0:15:36,830
barcelona has to be careful with

396
0:15:46,340 --> 0:15:38,210
those values ​​that went backwards

397
0:15:48,590 --> 0:15:41,270
luckily with the sensation that it can give

398
0:15:51,250 --> 0:15:44,810
is gradually regaining control

399
0:15:53,600 --> 0:15:46,340
sergi roberto delays

400
0:15:56,449 --> 0:15:48,590
gerard piqué's slip that comes from the  Pressure from

401
0:15:59,000 --> 0:15:51,250
Karim Benzema, Sergio Busquets playing

402
0:16:01,700 --> 0:15:53,600
with Andres Iniesta, Ivan Rakitic returns it

403
0:16:03,860 --> 0:15:56,449
between the lines.  s leo messi puts in

404
0:16:06,680 --> 0:15:59,000
for jordi alba he returns centrally he

405
0:16:08,990 --> 0:16:01,700
faces luis suárez to look for the

406
0:16:10,520 --> 0:16:03,860
shot

407
0:16:12,070 --> 0:16:06,680
he went to the right to

408
0:16:14,590 --> 0:16:08,990
luis suárez's shot

409
0:16:16,880 --> 0:16:10,520
make the barça in the game without a

410
0:16:18,980 --> 0:16:12,070
very good move by fc

411
0:16:20,450 --> 0:16:14,590
barcelona and jordi alba's great internal

412
0:16:22,730 --> 0:16:16,880
everyone was expecting a paid pass we had to

413
0:16:26,360 --> 0:16:18,980
do that he came in to finish off

414
0:16:28,100 --> 0:16:20,450
but that day I had seen

415
0:16:30,140 --> 0:16:22,730
luis suárez very well on the edge of the area that

416
0:16:32,270 --> 0:16:26,360
he did very well with quick control

417
0:16:33,860 --> 0:16:28,100
with a very good shot because he was going to

418
0:16:36,470 --> 0:16:30,140
grass level that if they had taken the

419
0:16:38,600 --> 0:16:32,270
goal would have put

420
0:16:40,490 --> 0:16:33,860
the base in many difficulties

421
0:16:42,980 --> 0:16:36,470
10 minutes of the game in the Clásico

422
0:16:45,940 --> 0:16:38,600
against Madrid 0 fc barcelona 0 ball for

423
0:16:49,190 --> 0:16:40,490
zinedine zidane's team sergio abramos hands over

424
0:16:51,440 --> 0:16:42,980
to marcelo

425
0:16:53,540 --> 0:16:45,940
ramos luis suárez squeezes him he plays with nacho

426
0:16:56,450 --> 0:16:49,190
the closeness of leo messi nacho to

427
0:16:58,820 --> 0:16:51,440
danny carvajal the perfect inward cut

428
0:17:01,040 --> 0:16:53,540
of the winger from leganés plays with

429
0:17:02,990 --> 0:16:56,450
casemiro's songbook changing

430
0:17:08,460 --> 0:16:58,820
but it is the first one that stayed

431
0:17:09,990 --> 0:17:01,040
with him  against the brazilian

432
0:17:11,670 --> 0:17:02,990
rakitic another one slips and there is the

433
0:17:13,650 --> 0:17:08,460
croat rakitic managing the leather very

434
0:17:16,200 --> 0:17:09,990
pressured he has to play with marc

435
0:17:17,640 --> 0:17:11,670
andre ter stegen

436
0:17:19,880 --> 0:17:13,650
alemany you will not have too much problem

437
0:17:21,380 --> 0:17:16,200
to play with the foot there is a marmoset with

438
0:17:24,740 --> 0:17:17,640
jordi alba

439
0:17:25,900 --> 0:17:19,880
deepening enough the

440
0:17:28,610 --> 0:17:21,380
barça side that is  itches and with gareth bale

441
0:17:31,929 --> 0:17:24,740
ball for sergio Busquets he gives himself

442
0:17:33,879 --> 0:17:25,900
to leo messi- appearing a lot

443
0:17:35,470 --> 0:17:28,610
inside argentinian he wants to leave

444
0:17:37,600 --> 0:17:31,929
casemiro there he was

445
0:17:39,600 --> 0:17:33,879
if messi goes back and card to go

446
0:17:41,880 --> 0:17:35,470
after cancer to the first yellow card of the

447
0:17:43,740 --> 0:17:37,600
game he left all the  barça the pressure

448
0:17:46,400 --> 0:17:39,600
casemiro

449
0:17:48,200 --> 0:17:41,880
booked at the 11th game yes because let's

450
0:17:51,179 --> 0:17:43,740
see it's like the saying is the first in the

451
0:17:54,360 --> 0:17:46,400
absence of almost less but at no

452
0:17:55,980 --> 0:17:48,200
time does he have the chance to touch the

453
0:17:59,100 --> 0:17:51,179
ball I think that there he comes out a little

454
0:18:00,299 --> 0:17:54,360
angry because of the dribbling he did  leo

455
0:18:02,039 --> 0:17:55,980
messi and there is a bit that it is already

456
0:18:04,500 --> 0:17:59,100
impossible for him to get in contact with the

457
0:18:06,750 --> 0:18:00,299
ball entered from behind and for my

458
0:18:09,059 --> 0:18:02,039
yellow card very well taken by

459
0:18:10,830 --> 0:18:04,500
hernández hernánde  z

460
0:18:12,790 --> 0:18:06,750
a very clear yellow card and also

461
0:18:14,860 --> 0:18:09,059
very stupid on the part of cashmere

462
0:18:16,240 --> 0:18:10,830
because he did not get to that play at any

463
0:18:20,080 --> 0:18:12,790
time and especially since minutes 10

464
0:18:22,300 --> 0:18:14,860
minutes 11 having a yellow card is

465
0:18:25,040 --> 0:18:16,240
as important for balance as it is

466
0:18:31,710 --> 0:18:20,080
if paco

467
0:18:34,460 --> 0:18:22,300
alcácer loses the ball

468
0:18:37,380 --> 0:18:25,040
Rubén de la Red was speaking directly outside if he

469
0:18:39,960 --> 0:18:31,710
was saying that it is a card that

470
0:18:41,779 --> 0:18:34,460
could be important for the

471
0:18:44,010 --> 0:18:37,380
remainder of the match, not above all

472
0:18:45,539 --> 0:18:39,960
what it has been used for he is a player who is in

473
0:18:47,130 --> 0:18:41,779
the axis he is the player who always has

474
0:18:48,929 --> 0:18:44,010
to come out  at the crossroads he has to balance

475
0:18:51,149 --> 0:18:45,539
the zones and here we see how he does not

476
0:18:53,100 --> 0:18:47,130
reach the center of the field there is still a

477
0:18:54,899 --> 0:18:48,929
long way to go and I do not think that

478
0:18:57,720 --> 0:18:51,149
Leo Messi's trap should not have fallen

479
0:18:59,130 --> 0:18:53,100
for having me without facing the sleeve

480
0:19:01,350 --> 0:18:54,899
for one side of anything for  others are

481
0:19:03,210 --> 0:18:57,720
trying to find and what does he look like he has

482
0:19:04,980 --> 0:18:59,130
fallen into his trap samuel heads in front of

483
0:19:07,679 --> 0:19:01,350
you ball in midfield the trend of the

484
0:19:09,480 --> 0:19:03,210
match little by little barça begins to change

485
0:19:12,059 --> 0:19:04,980
equalizing the contention  gives understanding

486
0:19:13,830 --> 0:19:07,679
ball

487
0:19:14,970 --> 0:19:09,480
region amos looking for the ball to the

488
0:19:17,340 --> 0:19:12,059
right where gareth bale is going to receive it

489
0:19:18,809 --> 0:19:13,830
down with his chest delivery for danny

490
0:19:21,059 --> 0:19:14,970
carvajal receives luka modric

491
0:19:24,280 --> 0:19:17,340
the player who is always decisive in

492
0:19:26,260 --> 0:19:18,809
real madrid's midfield moves

493
0:19:27,550 --> 0:19:21,059
gareth bale de luka modric puts the

494
0:19:29,680 --> 0:19:24,280
ball in  the superior mobiles

495
0:19:31,360 --> 0:19:26,260
so

496
0:19:34,380 --> 0:19:27,550
that he did was offside

497
0:19:38,240 --> 0:19:29,680
return remember to let

498
0:19:40,730 --> 0:19:31,360
real madrid's starting team dance after his

499
0:19:42,200 --> 0:19:34,380
absence here we see the action repeated and

500
0:19:45,200 --> 0:19:38,240
been a little early

501
0:19:48,450 --> 0:19:40,730
[Music]

502
0:19:49,690 --> 0:19:42,200
madrid

503
0:19:51,559 --> 0:19:45,200
has a very clear idea we have already seen

504
0:19:54,529 --> 0:19:48,450
several times  in which you try to win

505
0:19:56,509 --> 0:19:49,690
the back of the defense

506
0:20:02,010 --> 0:19:51,559
press very high it

507
0:20:04,590 --> 0:19:54,529
will be very easy barça

508
0:20:07,330 --> 0:19:56,509
in his symphony gerard piqué delivered

509
0:20:09,490 --> 0:20:02,010
for rakitic sergio Busquets for andrés

510
0:20:12,220 --> 0:20:04,590
iniesta entering from the left day

511
0:20:13,840 --> 0:20:07,330
for jordi alba alba looking for

512
0:20:17,650 --> 0:20:09,490
surrenders for wii suárez the offer is made

513
0:20:19,240 --> 0:20:12,220
uruguayan delivery for payment reach

514
0:20:22,400 --> 0:20:13,840
leo messi controls play sergio

515
0:20:24,140 --> 0:20:17,650
Busquets barça begins to live in the

516
0:20:26,660 --> 0:20:19,240
camp  or from real madrid jordi alba handed over

517
0:20:30,080 --> 0:20:22,400
by andrés iniesta manchegos leaves mind

518
0:20:33,299 --> 0:20:24,140
possession of fc barcelona Busquets luis

519
0:20:36,869 --> 0:20:26,660
suárez each time

520
0:20:39,960 --> 0:20:30,080
luis enrique's team lasted i think barça is

521
0:20:41,850 --> 0:20:33,299
missing neymar from

522
0:20:44,270 --> 0:20:36,869
barça a

523
0:20:46,190 --> 0:20:39,960
lot in presence of real's pitch

524
0:20:48,080 --> 0:20:41,850
if madrid doesn't find leo messi, there

525
0:20:50,600 --> 0:20:44,270
is no way to put

526
0:20:52,250 --> 0:20:46,190
real madrid's defense in difficulty when he comes

527
0:20:56,160 --> 0:20:48,080
and users are not asking for much to

528
0:20:57,930 --> 0:20:50,600
receive and I think that today barça is going to

529
0:21:00,990 --> 0:20:52,250
need more than ever the argentinian tie a

530
0:21:03,740 --> 0:20:56,160
quarter of an hour into the match

531
0:21:06,060 --> 0:20:57,930
santiago bernabéu stadium the serve of keylor

532
0:21:07,890 --> 0:21:00,990
navas

533
0:21:09,490 --> 0:21:03,740
and he was about to steal luís suárez

534
0:21:12,659 --> 0:21:06,060
throw-in for the white team

535
0:21:14,549 --> 0:21:07,890
looking for that race gareth bale it is benzema

536
0:21:17,039 --> 0:21:09,490
the one who fights with a titín he took the

537
0:21:19,349 --> 0:21:12,659
ball from the center of the french

538
0:21:22,800 --> 0:21:14,549
sergio Busquets is the 5 of the  barça handles

539
0:21:26,880 --> 0:21:17,039
the ball

540
0:21:28,140 --> 0:21:19,349
Busquets floor of the ball and that he be

541
0:21:30,540 --> 0:21:22,800
with ivan rakitic

542
0:21:31,930 --> 0:21:26,880
[Applause]

543
0:21:33,320 --> 0:21:28,140
and that they are the right one for sergi roberto

544
0:21:39,420 --> 0:21:30,540
but you made me look for another

545
0:21:42,030 --> 0:21:31,930
hotel  stegen

546
0:21:43,260 --> 0:21:33,320
and barça playing control football yes,

547
0:21:45,990 --> 0:21:39,420
but control football without

548
0:21:47,400 --> 0:21:42,030
permanence does it in the opposite field and look where

549
0:21:49,170 --> 0:21:43,260
he is putting it to real madrid it is

550
0:21:50,910 --> 0:21:45,990
control football but it is their own area on their

551
0:21:53,040 --> 0:21:47,400
own pitch and there

552
0:21:55,470 --> 0:21:49,170
barça feels a little uncomfortable  fight the

553
0:21:58,470 --> 0:21:50,910
ball ball luka modric a marmoset gets

554
0:22:00,480 --> 0:21:53,040
ahead of the stands iniesta plays for

555
0:22:03,210 --> 0:21:55,470
Busquets again samuel before you

556
0:22:05,750 --> 0:21:58,470
drinking the ball barça wanted not to

557
0:22:07,640 --> 0:22:00,480
wear down real madrid in that pressure;

558
0:22:14,690 --> 0:22:03,210
control that isn't

559
0:22:17,540 --> 0:22:05,750
good carvajal took it away

560
0:22:20,470 --> 0:22:07,640
when i did the balls but

561
0:22:21,970 --> 0:22:10,400
halfway inside christian danger

562
0:22:26,680 --> 0:22:12,170
and avoids the dangerous action that would have

563
0:22:28,990 --> 0:22:14,690
left karim benzema alone against ter

564
0:22:30,970 --> 0:22:17,540
stegen

565
0:22:31,850 --> 0:22:20,470
well that's what real madrid wants to achieve

566
0:22:33,410 --> 0:22:21,970
with such pressure  high that he

567
0:22:35,630 --> 0:22:26,680
is stealing and having the opportunity that

568
0:22:38,299 --> 0:22:28,990
in any unmarking of Christian benzema he

569
0:22:41,179 --> 0:22:30,970
generates

570
0:22:43,950 --> 0:22:31,850
if the driving is planted they

571
0:22:48,260 --> 0:22:33,410
crossed and carvajal

572
0:22:50,120 --> 0:22:35,630
[Apla  uses]

573
0:22:54,080 --> 0:22:38,299
with the lights on if it is an

574
0:22:56,539 --> 0:22:39,740
unstoppable team as I told you it is to turn

575
0:22:59,269 --> 0:22:41,179
later to any option you want to

576
0:23:01,880 --> 0:22:43,950
remove the ball and I think that madrid

577
0:23:04,220 --> 0:22:48,260
has to be very aware of leo

578
0:23:06,230 --> 0:22:50,120
messi because that is where all the trouble will come from

579
0:23:08,149 --> 0:22:54,080
barça's attack sergi roberto

580
0:23:09,950 --> 0:22:56,539
centers the short area casemiro the

581
0:23:12,200 --> 0:22:59,269
counter is coming

582
0:23:13,340 --> 0:23:01,880
2 liters for caribbeans very easy very only he

583
0:23:16,460 --> 0:23:04,220
will continue between for christian christian

584
0:23:18,559 --> 0:23:06,230
out of town because just what the

585
0:23:23,110 --> 0:23:08,149
above I think it is rickety when

586
0:23:24,850 --> 0:23:09,950
seeing messi of that leadership he did not give

587
0:23:27,159 --> 0:23:12,200
continuity  not why messi did see

588
0:23:29,730 --> 0:23:13,340
the myths as a result of the cup but at

589
0:23:31,830 --> 0:23:16,460
the last moment I think he

590
0:23:33,990 --> 0:23:18,559
slows down his career and makes him unable to

591
0:23:35,879 --> 0:23:23,110
reach that ball that the mdl to messi

592
0:23:41,070 --> 0:23:24,850
that is and even the repeated image has

593
0:23:42,960 --> 0:23:27,159
arranged

594
0:23:44,590 --> 0:23:29,730
I thought offside the assistant

595
0:23:46,919 --> 0:23:31,830
understood that he had to cut off the

596
0:23:49,179 --> 0:23:33,990
king's advance

597
0:23:51,460 --> 0:23:35,879
many works for entrance Christian moves

598
0:23:57,080 --> 0:23:41,070
[Applause]

599
0:24:01,060 --> 0:23:42,960
m there is a very clear opportunity that the

600
0:24:04,520 --> 0:23:44,590
execution has not been the best

601
0:24:06,659 --> 0:23:46,919
care ca  mara barba

602
0:24:08,750 --> 0:23:49,179
luis suárez's shot

603
0:24:11,210 --> 0:23:51,460
goes wide after the decade of payment

604
0:24:14,450 --> 0:23:54,220
20 seconds 2

605
0:24:16,480 --> 0:23:57,080
goal to goal but the 0 0 continues if it

606
0:24:20,080 --> 0:24:01,060
is clear that in madrid he is a little

607
0:24:21,970 --> 0:24:04,520
more dominating the game but here it is

608
0:24:23,890 --> 0:24:06,659
impossible at minute 18 to predict a

609
0:24:26,710 --> 0:24:08,750
result because  we have seen in these

610
0:24:28,299 --> 0:24:11,210
last 20

611
0:24:29,830 --> 0:24:14,450
seconds madrid has a very good chance

612
0:24:31,059 --> 0:24:16,480
but in a small oversight it is a

613
0:24:33,520 --> 0:24:20,080
perfect pass that for what to do it will be to

614
0:24:36,100 --> 0:24:21,970
leave it in perfect condition you know

615
0:24:37,780 --> 0:24:23,890
what i wanted it to have to finish

616
0:24:39,970 --> 0:24:26,710
first and a great chance for

617
0:24:42,160 --> 0:24:28,299
barça i think we are facing  a

618
0:24:43,600 --> 0:24:29,830
very high level of classic and everything can happen the

619
0:24:47,830 --> 0:24:31,059
game is beautiful it is beautiful you are

620
0:24:51,240 --> 0:24:33,520
seeing part of the two teams we have seen

621
0:24:53,490 --> 0:24:36,100
before two or three players have shown superiority

622
0:24:55,320 --> 0:24:37,780
a real madrid that I

623
0:24:57,809 --> 0:24:39,970
think has control of the match

624
0:24:59,490 --> 0:24:42,160
but not  It can be neglected by

625
0:25:02,160 --> 0:24:43,600
soccer players who have a lot of potential to do one

626
0:25:03,540 --> 0:24:47,830
and are showing that they have

627
0:25:05,340 --> 0:24:49,809
had several occasions to be able to

628
0:25:06,900 --> 0:24:51,240
do it too

629
0:25:09,230 --> 0:24:53,490
or  In a very active party, the two ethnic groups

630
0:25:11,419 --> 0:24:55,320
are not doing

631
0:25:13,179 --> 0:24:57,809
well offensively, neither of

632
0:25:16,880 --> 0:24:59,490
them is trying to speculate again,

633
0:25:19,190 --> 0:25:02,160
they are trying to be amarrategui, but on

634
0:25:21,710 --> 0:25:03,540
the contrary, they were not going to

635
0:25:23,179 --> 0:25:05,340
play an attacking game and that is making

636
0:25:25,250 --> 0:25:06,900
it a very showy game for them.

637
0:25:26,540 --> 0:25:09,230
amateur he hit him very badly there is luís

638
0:25:28,400 --> 0:25:11,419
suárez before they animate he sends a little

639
0:25:30,799 --> 0:25:13,179
he hit him well because

640
0:25:32,740 --> 0:25:16,880
the truth is that it was much better than how

641
0:25:34,330 --> 0:25:19,190
he could execute later

642
0:25:36,419 --> 0:25:21,710
and this time he is challenging casemiro because

643
0:25:39,299 --> 0:25:23,179
he is

644
0:25:40,590 --> 0:25:25,250
only 10

645
0:25:42,640 --> 0:25:26,540
marcelo for christian ronaldo christian

646
0:25:45,580 --> 0:25:28,400
that he goes against gerard piqué in

647
0:25:47,140 --> 0:25:30,799
a full left against christian

648
0:25:51,650 --> 0:25:32,740
that the others have taken

649
0:25:54,350 --> 0:25:34,330
but it was very hard as an open christian

650
0:25:57,289 --> 0:25:36,419
with blood on benz and leo

651
0:26:00,440 --> 0:25:39,299
messi bleeding from the

652
0:26:02,759 --> 0:25:40,590
grato mouth in argentina it

653
0:26:05,230 --> 0:25:42,640
happened just after what we saw is

654
0:26:08,350 --> 0:25:45,580
an extraordinary hand of  ter stegen yes

655
0:26:12,520 --> 0:25:47,140
again with casimiro we are going to see the

656
0:26:15,160 --> 0:25:51,650
repetition at first it seemed that

657
0:26:16,929 --> 0:25:54,350
nothing was happening but here it was not

658
0:26:19,660 --> 0:25:57,289
recorded with the nation with m  Arcelo Marcelo hits

659
0:26:22,090 --> 0:26:00,440
him in the nose with his elbow,

660
0:26:24,429 --> 0:26:02,759
let's see, let's hope he doesn't have anything,

661
0:26:26,350 --> 0:26:05,230
nothing important, that his nose isn't broken,

662
0:26:31,480 --> 0:26:08,350
but I think Marcelo,

663
0:26:34,140 --> 0:26:12,520
I think it's involuntary, there's

664
0:26:35,970 --> 0:26:15,160
no time he's going to hurt him,

665
0:26:39,530 --> 0:26:16,929
panels and

666
0:26:40,430 --> 0:26:19,660
[Applause]

667
0:26:42,310 --> 0:26:22,090
Marcelo Nessi  They arrive very evenly on that

668
0:26:46,370 --> 0:26:24,429
ball and we see how Marcelo doesn't even go

669
0:26:48,770 --> 0:26:26,350
very strong, he goes

670
0:26:50,890 --> 0:26:30,100
to enter with the inside, they

671
0:26:52,900 --> 0:26:31,480
even took a small jump

672
0:26:54,670 --> 0:26:34,140
that in the end that generates you for not having

673
0:26:58,270 --> 0:26:35,970
stability there because when he opens his arms

674
0:27:00,850 --> 0:26:39,530
he hits Lionel Messi  in the mouth but

675
0:27:03,760 --> 0:26:40,430
luckily for messi

676
0:27:06,010 --> 0:26:42,310
I think it was better in the mouth

677
0:27:07,930 --> 0:26:46,370
because it must have been swimming and it

678
0:27:09,430 --> 0:26:48,770
could have broken his nose it seems

679
0:27:11,560 --> 0:26:50,890
that it is in the upper lip and that he has

680
0:27:13,540 --> 0:26:52,900
made a small gap on the

681
0:27:15,430 --> 0:26:54,670
inside  and when I say that it is not

682
0:27:17,940 --> 0:26:58,270
intentional, it is Marcelo, we know

683
0:27:19,990 --> 0:27:00,850
Marcelo is not a controversial player, he is not

684
0:27:22,450 --> 0:27:03,760
a player

685
0:27:24,179 --> 0:27:06,010
who never goes with bad intentions and

686
0:27:27,059 --> 0:27:07,930
that is why I base myself on that type of thing and we have

687
0:27:29,820 --> 0:27:09,430
seen there what he has done c  Like when he

688
0:27:31,440 --> 0:27:11,560
was with the physio, it was when he

689
0:27:33,419 --> 0:27:13,540
raised his arms due to

690
0:27:35,549 --> 0:27:15,430
inertia itself and I don't think it was

691
0:27:38,820 --> 0:27:17,940
to hurt the Argentine

692
0:27:41,070 --> 0:27:19,990
momentarily, Barça with 10 leo messi

693
0:27:47,340 --> 0:27:22,450
preventing

694
0:27:56,650 --> 0:27:24,179
the Welshman from appearing breaks the offside in

695
0:27:58,840 --> 0:27:27,059
the heads-up  but he throws the ball very

696
0:28:01,840 --> 0:27:29,820
gently to the lehmann goalkeeper

697
0:28:04,960 --> 0:27:31,440
because if he surprises us, i was

698
0:28:06,610 --> 0:27:33,419
surprised that he wanted to define

699
0:28:08,020 --> 0:27:35,549
first because he had won the position

700
0:28:09,490 --> 0:27:38,820
and good control nor would he have given a

701
0:28:11,649 --> 0:27:41,070
much clearer definition andrés

702
0:28:13,659 --> 0:27:47,340
german goalkeeper but if it comes out

703
0:28:15,880 --> 0:27:56,650
That intention that the Welshman

704
0:28:18,960 --> 0:27:58,840
had could have surprised you because he

705
0:28:21,159 --> 0:28:01,840
had a lot of space between 3d in and the

706
0:28:22,809 --> 0:28:04,960
goal, attention to the confusion, another goal

707
0:28:24,700 --> 0:28:06,610
from Barça, the ball to fall in Vail,

708
0:28:26,909 --> 0:28:08,020
we continue with the continuous attack in the

709
0:28:29,169 --> 0:28:09,490
game that you see, he puts it

710
0:28:32,530 --> 0:28:11,649
there, we have not seen it, but  it seems to me that it

711
0:28:34,480 --> 0:28:13,659
came from a throw-in to the mistake in

712
0:28:36,760 --> 0:28:15,880
the defense of barcelona

713
0:28:38,430 --> 0:28:18,960
not perhaps we will have an image to clear

714
0:28:42,520 --> 0:28:21,159
up doubts leo messi already on the field at the

715
0:28:45,370 --> 0:28:22,809
moment  with dressings over his mouth, yes,

716
0:28:50,260 --> 0:28:24,700
because if they are an external gap, then

717
0:28:52,330 --> 0:28:26,909
you put something on it to cover the bleeding,

718
0:28:54,520 --> 0:28:29,169
but to do it inside, it has to be

719
0:28:56,800 --> 0:28:32,530
there with something until it separates or

720
0:29:01,940 --> 0:28:34,480
the gap can be made, danny carvajal takes out the ball

721
0:29:04,279 --> 0:28:36,760
so that he assured that

722
0:29:05,929 --> 0:28:38,430
The Brazilian often turns to perfection, dribbling at the same

723
0:29:08,389 --> 0:28:42,520
time and Casemiro looking for the ball to the

724
0:29:11,210 --> 0:28:45,370
left towards Marcelo

725
0:29:14,250 --> 0:28:50,260
and Roberto Marcelo, go for Cristiano

726
0:29:18,130 --> 0:28:52,330
Cristiano on the left

727
0:29:21,299 --> 0:28:54,520
from Cristiano deviated but there are already many

728
0:29:24,720 --> 0:28:56,800
shots on goal especially from Real

729
0:29:27,330 --> 0:29:00,340
Madrid yes but I think  that there is a lack of

730
0:29:28,919 --> 0:29:01,940
communication between nogales del beni from

731
0:29:30,690 --> 0:29:04,279
behind without a race and he was surely

732
0:29:33,059 --> 0:29:05,929
much better positioned than

733
0:29:34,529 --> 0:29:08,389
christian ronaldo we do not see it

734
0:29:36,690 --> 0:29:11,210
there the psuv would have taken him is I was

735
0:29:38,759 --> 0:29:14,250
convinced and see if it surely generated

736
0:29:41,249 --> 0:29:18,130
more more danger than what

737
0:29:42,419 --> 0:29:21,299
christian ronaldo has done  and this is the occasion

738
0:29:43,889 --> 0:29:24,720
that we talked about before here I thought that

739
0:29:45,570 --> 0:29:27,330
a control that gave him to define but

740
0:29:48,029 --> 0:29:28,919
but be careful that the intention of d  the

741
0:29:49,919 --> 0:29:30,690
welshman is nothing without her finding the

742
0:29:52,049 --> 0:29:33,059
inside comes a vaseline we see that

743
0:29:53,609 --> 0:29:34,529
the german goalkeeper was a little far away

744
0:29:54,960 --> 0:29:36,690
there and it would have been a real

745
0:29:56,489 --> 0:29:38,759
goal for andrés iniesta delivery for leo

746
0:29:59,100 --> 0:29:41,249
messi be with sergio Busquets opening

747
0:30:01,080 --> 0:29:42,419
the left

748
0:30:03,860 --> 0:29:43,889
of Sergio Busquets indeed extra

749
0:30:07,170 --> 0:29:45,570
Cristiano  ronaldo jordi alba

750
0:30:10,200 --> 0:29:48,029
the cancer race let's see why there is no

751
0:30:11,610 --> 0:29:49,919
offside paco alcácer remember and

752
0:30:14,559 --> 0:29:52,049
carvajal but he is very fast on the side

753
0:30:17,539 --> 0:29:53,609
for ccoo he has to be much more dagger

754
0:30:19,669 --> 0:29:54,960
on that flank and he beats those five or

755
0:30:22,190 --> 0:29:56,489
six meters with

756
0:30:25,610 --> 0:29:59,100
oriented control  with his right foot

757
0:30:27,559 --> 0:30:01,080
and getting into the area, they have to

758
0:30:29,360 --> 0:30:03,860
hesitate to work when entering him

759
0:30:31,190 --> 0:30:07,170
because he is inside the area, I think

760
0:30:33,080 --> 0:30:10,200
he waits too long and then wants to do

761
0:30:35,420 --> 0:30:11,610
a dribble, which in one-on-one

762
0:30:36,980 --> 0:30:14,559
working is not easy, I think  that he

763
0:30:39,140 --> 0:30:17,539
had the opportunity to beat the cancer

764
0:30:41,150 --> 0:30:19,669
to have been a little more

765
0:30:43,540 --> 0:30:22,190
like I mentioned before, a dagger towards the

766
0:30:46,070 --> 0:30:25,610
goal of keylor navas or maybe that is why

767
0:30:48,170 --> 0:30:27,559
luis enrique has decided  do put paco

768
0:30:50,390 --> 0:30:29,360
alcácer anticipating this type of

769
0:30:51,770 --> 0:30:31,190
situation instead of a denis

770
0:30:53,570 --> 0:30:33,080
suárez instead of an andrés gómez who are more

771
0:30:55,460 --> 0:30:35,420
midfielders than paco and there

772
0:30:58,429 --> 0:30:36,980
because the responsibility that paco

773
0:31:00,410 --> 0:30:39,140
alcácer has when facing

774
0:31:02,480 --> 0:30:41,150
when doing  one on one we see that there are

775
0:31:04,549 --> 0:30:43,540
situations in which he only has

776
0:31:06,320 --> 0:30:46,070
the support of luis suárez there he has to

777
0:31:08,210 --> 0:30:48,170
make the determination of power in

778
0:31:10,730 --> 0:30:50,390
order to be able to generate the dangerous situation

779
0:31:13,630 --> 0:30:51,770
of five minutes in the hands of luca modric

780
0:31:16,400 --> 0:30:53,570
well of hernández fernández who had

781
0:31:18,170 --> 0:30:55,460
supported himself  the croatian in the arm so

782
0:31:20,630 --> 0:30:58,429
the ball returns to the power of fc

783
0:31:23,660 --> 0:31:00,410
barcelona for this action

784
0:31:27,490 --> 0:31:02,480
seen the repetition is what

785
0:31:29,630 --> 0:31:04,549
hernández has understood hernández

786
0:31:32,010 --> 0:31:06,320
was deserving of a foul here we go the

787
0:31:33,930 --> 0:31:08,210
great save by ter stegen because the shot

788
0:31:36,120 --> 0:31:10,730
is very violent by christian he sees it  he does

789
0:31:38,970 --> 0:31:13,630
everything very fast

790
0:31:41,420 --> 0:31:16,400
when he had us accustomed to these

791
0:31:42,830 --> 0:31:18,170
things at his best the fast moment

792
0:31:44,630 --> 0:31:20,630
although the right and shot to kill

793
0:31:46,190 --> 0:31:23,660
madrid

794
0:31:48,650 --> 0:31:27,490
wants to cut

795
0:31:51,360 --> 0:31:29,630
sergio Busquets

796
0:31:54,100 --> 0:31:32,010
recup  it was the cycle of barça delivery

797
0:31:56,080 --> 0:31:33,930
sergi roberto for ivan rakitic

798
0:31:58,510 --> 0:31:36,120
real madrid lost a great opportunity to

799
0:31:59,799 --> 0:31:38,970
attack a two for two

800
0:32:01,990 --> 0:31:41,420
iniesta

801
0:32:03,429 --> 0:31:42,830
ivan rakitic

802
0:32:05,690 --> 0:31:44,630
the croatian keeps the ball

803
0:32:07,789 --> 0:31:46,190
advancing little by little

804
0:32:09,799 --> 0:31:48,650
delivery for sergi roberto sergio

805
0:32:11,509 --> 0:31:51,360
Busquets leo messi again against

806
0:32:14,360 --> 0:31:54,100
casemiro uno  of the duels of the match

807
0:32:16,250 --> 0:31:56,080
there it is fine if

808
0:32:18,019 --> 0:31:58,510
leo messi dribbles him again the argentinian leaves for the

809
0:32:19,879 --> 0:31:59,799
moment beating

810
0:32:22,789 --> 0:32:01,990
casemiro in that pairing I lie if he does

811
0:32:26,149 --> 0:32:03,429
well to look here severely because he has

812
0:32:28,159 --> 0:32:05,690
that yellow card that now in

813
0:32:29,990 --> 0:32:07,789
any inning only  he's going to think a lot

814
0:32:31,909 --> 0:32:09,799
more because leo messi, even though it seems

815
0:32:34,490 --> 0:32:11,509
that you get to the ball at the last moment,

816
0:32:36,200 --> 0:32:14,360
puts the pointer in your direction and makes you make

817
0:32:38,419 --> 0:32:16,250
contact with him, attention I'm roberto they

818
0:32:40,789 --> 0:32:18,019
take off wide they take

819
0:32:42,259 --> 0:32:19,879
paco alcácer offside but the referee does very well

820
0:32:43,610 --> 0:32:22,789
letting continue

821
0:32:46,240 --> 0:32:26,149
if they lose, in fact they lose, jordi alba takes it

822
0:32:51,000 --> 0:32:28,159
[Music]

823
0:32:52,850 --> 0:32:29,990
roberto contributes barceló leaves the coast of

824
0:32:55,610 --> 0:32:31,909
brega madrid

825
0:32:57,190 --> 0:32:34,490
the referee gets angry the public d  the

826
0:32:58,780 --> 0:32:36,200
bernabéu

827
0:32:59,910 --> 0:32:38,419
the value of modica to the right for

828
0:33:01,680 --> 0:32:40,789
christian ronaldo or in touch of

829
0:33:03,240 --> 0:32:42,259
christian for carvajal

830
0:33:05,570 --> 0:32:43,610
[Applause]

831
0:33:08,260 --> 0:32:46,240
only gerard piqué

832
0:33:10,169 --> 0:32:48,190
to each corner for real madrid let's

833
0:33:12,509 --> 0:32:51,000
keep a bernabéu

834
0:33:14,459 --> 0:32:52,850
totally involved not

835
0:33:16,270 --> 0:32:55,610
[Applause]

836
0:33:17,450 --> 0:32:57,190
in the midfield

837
0:33:21,090 --> 0:32:58,780
of spectacular fiction and  that is noticeable

838
0:33:23,880 --> 0:32:59,910
when you are inter the game mode

839
0:33:25,670 --> 0:33:01,680
both the home team and the

840
0:33:27,410 --> 0:33:03,240
away team is not that breath in public

841
0:33:30,620 --> 0:33:05,570
today is being spectacular attention to

842
0:33:33,560 --> 0:33:08,260
real madrid's aerial power- the

843
0:33:35,380 --> 0:33:10,169
corner kicks will put

844
0:33:37,210 --> 0:33:12,509
toni kroos from the right

845
0:33:39,030 --> 0:33:14,459
pay attention to ramos xabi and the christian

846
0:33:42,250 --> 0:33:16,270
clears ter stegen because of the fist of the

847
0:33:43,750 --> 0:33:17,450
source to marcelo marcelo can put the

848
0:33:46,059 --> 0:33:21,090
center he does it trying to solve

849
0:33:49,010 --> 0:33:23,880
sabino

850
0:33:50,640 --> 0:33:25,670
[Applause]

851
0:34:01,340 --> 0:33:27,410
but after the corner kick the

852
0:34:03,990 --> 0:33:30,620
second ball arrives for sergio ramos

853
0:34:10,829 --> 0:33:33,560
and casemiro just has to  push

854
0:34:13,228 --> 0:33:35,380
to make the first in a ball for

855
0:34:15,958 --> 0:33:37,210
unevenness to madrid

856
0:34:18,040 --> 0:33:39,030
to euro

857
0:34:19,230 --> 0:33:42,250
fc barcelona but well here you can see another

858
0:34:23,050 --> 0:33:43,750
goal this season there

859
0:34:24,790 --> 0:33:46,059
are several who  and they put in we see

860
0:34:27,790 --> 0:33:49,010
how it arrives there there is no

861
0:34:29,560 --> 0:33:50,640
offside there is no offside of neither

862
0:34:31,179 --> 0:34:01,340
Cristiano Ronaldo nor Sergio Ramos

863
0:34:32,860 --> 0:34:03,990
how it arrives at that far post those

864
0:34:35,290 --> 0:34:10,829
plays are very difficult to defend

865
0:34:36,760 --> 0:34:13,228
when the ball is rejected the

866
0:34:38,560 --> 0:34:15,958
defense is coming out it enters from  back

867
0:34:40,780 --> 0:34:18,040
cristiano ronaldo sergio ramos a

868
0:34:42,219 --> 0:34:19,230
little more rushed in line but he finishes off

869
0:34:45,100 --> 0:34:23,050
totally we only see how the defense

870
0:34:46,929 --> 0:34:24,790
of the game forgives he stares at the

871
0:34:48,668 --> 0:34:27,790
ball looking at the ball and casemiro

872
0:34:51,010 --> 0:34:29,560
totally just the only thing he has to

873
0:34:53,260 --> 0:34:31,179
do is push the ball into the net

874
0:34:54,850 --> 0:34:32,860
first goal since  madrid you could see the madridista coming, he was

875
0:34:57,310 --> 0:34:35,290
pulling a lot he was

876
0:34:58,720 --> 0:34:36,760
pressing and it was a matter of minutes that

877
0:35:00,880 --> 0:34:38,560
if he continued without the things the goal was going to

878
0:35:02,860 --> 0:34:40,780
come I have seen a drop in that pique cut let's

879
0:35:05,920 --> 0:34:42,219
see what the team said

880
0:35:07,750 --> 0:34:45,100
calm down calm down and don't agree he

881
0:35:09,730 --> 0:34:46,929
has  What to say that the

882
0:35:12,079 --> 0:34:48,668
calm team that increases intensity that Barça

883
0:35:14,299 --> 0:34:51,010
increases rhythm when the rhythm of the

884
0:35:16,549 --> 0:34:53,260
ball and intensity increases is when you can

885
0:35:18,200 --> 0:34:54,850
put real mad difficulty  rid and if it's

886
0:35:20,240 --> 0:34:57,310
okay in this let's say in this rhythm of the

887
0:35:22,519 --> 0:34:58,720
ball touching the field that doesn't

888
0:35:24,740 --> 0:35:00,880
hurt real madrid in the apple tree they have the

889
0:35:26,930 --> 0:35:02,860
opportunity today to win this classic I think

890
0:35:28,970 --> 0:35:05,920
that barça has football and

891
0:35:30,710 --> 0:35:07,750
dynamics to do more in this in this

892
0:35:34,250 --> 0:35:09,730
match but  don't calm her down with the

893
0:35:35,690 --> 0:35:12,079
calm that she asks for

894
0:35:37,880 --> 0:35:14,299
the leader to bite ahead of real madrid who

895
0:35:39,800 --> 0:35:16,549
would be giving a practically definitive blow to the league

896
0:35:41,600 --> 0:35:18,200
with a six

897
0:35:43,520 --> 0:35:20,240
point advantage over barça who has

898
0:35:46,130 --> 0:35:22,519
no choice but to seek immediate reaction

899
0:35:47,810 --> 0:35:24,740
ball for samuel ortí

900
0:35:50,530 --> 0:35:26,930
the french clone puts up with you he gives himself to

901
0:35:52,760 --> 0:35:28,970
andrés iniesta again a titin he has

902
0:35:55,580 --> 0:35:30,710
paco alcácer but he can't give him the

903
0:35:57,290 --> 0:35:34,250
balls

904
0:35:58,730 --> 0:35:35,690
retracted barça play and play without delving

905
0:36:00,830 --> 0:35:37,880
for the moment

906
0:36:02,300 --> 0:35:39,800
gerard piqué to the right for sergi

907
0:36:04,400 --> 0:35:41,600
roberto when your cousin is just in the

908
0:36:06,380 --> 0:35:43,520
middle  now he comes to ask leo

909
0:36:07,990 --> 0:35:46,130
messi if he is very far from the goal and it is

910
0:36:10,790 --> 0:35:47,810
also if next to cristian or

911
0:36:12,050 --> 0:35:50,530
precisely sergi roberto

912
0:36:14,630 --> 0:35:52,760
the right back of barça comes from inside

913
0:36:16,130 --> 0:35:55,580
whom we have seen very little in the

914
0:36:17,840 --> 0:35:57,290
game

915
0:36:18,590 --> 0:35:58,730
[Applause]

916
0:36:23,630 --> 0:36:00,830
/ good ball for rakitic rakitic

917
0:36:26,630 --> 0:36:02,300
on leo messi leo messi for luis

918
0:36:28,490 --> 0:36:04,400
suárez but for

919
0:36:31,010 --> 0:36:06,380
the brazilian against leo messi's mark he

920
0:36:33,260 --> 0:36:07,990
wants to make the play recovers

921
0:36:37,910 --> 0:36:10,790
Busquets with the ball he sends for sergi

922
0:36:40,940 --> 0:36:12,050
roberto receives  leo messi

923
0:36:44,150 --> 0:36:14,630
menzi goes inside he wants to do the

924
0:36:45,829 --> 0:36:16,130
diagonal month and delivers for andrés

925
0:36:47,089 --> 0:36:17,840
iniesta iniesta with danny carvajal

926
0:36:49,690 --> 0:36:18,590
iniesta who wants to leave the

927
0:36:51,589 --> 0:36:23,630
side of the king

928
0:36:52,990 --> 0:36:26,630
jordi alba falls down the carvajal path

929
0:36:55,630 --> 0:36:28,490
jordi alba now stays with a lot of

930
0:36:58,750 --> 0:36:31,010
space the days we will see

931
0:37:00,280 --> 0:36:33,260
what makes me leave yes for ivan

932
0:37:03,490 --> 0:36:37,910
rakitic Busquets again leo messi

933
0:37:06,430 --> 0:36:40,940
luka modric's mark second a lot realmadrid

934
0:37:07,930 --> 0:36:44,150
casemiro missing on leo messi

935
0:37:12,930 --> 0:36:45,829
he comes back

936
0:37:14,700 --> 0:36:47,089
I think it's barça's fault he is

937
0:37:18,089 --> 0:36:49,690
looking more than ever for leo messi to

938
0:37:21,060 --> 0:36:51,589
be a  little thick when

939
0:37:23,220 --> 0:36:52,990
looking for attacking moves and

940
0:37:25,710 --> 0:36:55,630
even paco alcácer himself from barça who always

941
0:37:27,540 --> 0:36:58,750
plays with open forwards in

942
0:37:30,599 --> 0:37:00,280
wings to open spaces and what  And the

943
0:37:32,520 --> 0:37:03,490
men receive it more calmly,

944
0:37:33,920 --> 0:37:06,430
we see that it goes inwards

945
0:37:36,690 --> 0:37:07,930
as we see it again in this move and

946
0:37:38,520 --> 0:37:12,930
if we jordi alba who is made up of

947
0:37:40,230 --> 0:37:14,700
attack they do not have

948
0:37:43,369 --> 0:37:18,089
for that fact that we have seen it seems

949
0:37:45,410 --> 0:37:21,060
tremendous to me is when on madrid

950
0:37:48,410 --> 0:37:23,220
the  barcelona only three fouls in 32

951
0:37:51,230 --> 0:37:25,710
minutes of the entire game and barça

952
0:37:53,180 --> 0:37:27,540
that has not made any in 31 minutes

953
0:37:54,740 --> 0:37:30,599
is not usual it is not an indication

954
0:37:56,630 --> 0:37:32,520
of everything we have seen in these

955
0:37:59,210 --> 0:37:33,920
30 minutes

956
0:38:00,960 --> 0:37:36,690
also it has been the one that has had the

957
0:38:02,910 --> 0:37:38,520
initiative that has  had the position of

958
0:38:04,380 --> 0:37:40,230
courage is that he has had the chances and

959
0:38:06,510 --> 0:37:43,369
a fire

960
0:38:09,990 --> 0:37:45,410
above

961
0:38:11,310 --> 0:37:48,410
[Applause]

962
0:38:17,509 --> 0:37:51,230
the savior of barça where I read messi the

963
0:38:21,799 --> 0:37:53,180
action of the argentinian does not and do others

964
0:38:25,229 --> 0:37:54,740
leak from the defense the dribble the shot

965
0:38:27,660 --> 0:37:56,630
down to the rescue or if barça equalizes

966
0:38:32,580 --> 0:37:59,210
and one

967
0:38:33,450 --> 0:38:00,960
[Applause] well,

968
0:38:35,260 --> 0:38:02,910
the best player in

969
0:38:37,640 --> 0:38:04,380
history appears I think Leo Messi is today the one

970
0:38:41,030 --> 0:38:06,510
who can make this uneven in

971
0:38:44,180 --> 0:38:09,990
favor of FC Barcelona everyone can

972
0:38:46,849 --> 0:38:11,310
play well but in the end this move is

973
0:38:48,890 --> 0:38:17,509
worthy of him  he goes very well from madrid he

974
0:38:51,800 --> 0:38:21,799
makes a one on one there to

975
0:38:53,690 --> 0:38:25,229
carvajal very quickly and when we see that

976
0:38:55,760 --> 0:38:27,660
the ball is left to his left leg it is

977
0:38:57,530 --> 0:38:32,580
possible that keylor navas could

978
0:38:59,210 --> 0:38:33,450
do something he had a lot of time to

979
0:39:01,040 --> 0:38:35,260
think about a situation that he has

980
0:39:03,230 --> 0:38:37,640
found  a million times and that he

981
0:39:05,030 --> 0:38:41,030
does it like nobody else messi levels the game

982
0:39:07,130 --> 0:38:44,180
and he is the one who can do this he takes

983
0:39:10,970 --> 0:38:46,849
a blaugrana color

984
0:39:12,660 --> 0:38:48,890
a great goal with the cons watching

985
0:39:14,520 --> 0:38:51,800
leonel messi as a dribble how he gets

986
0:39:16,980 --> 0:38:53,690
in turns at the last moment and does it  very

987
0:39:19,650 --> 0:38:55,760
simple from face to face than lorna more

988
0:39:22,990 --> 0:38:57,530
[Applause]

989
0:39:25,920 --> 0:38:59,210
the match that has

990
0:39:28,339 --> 0:39:01,040
three minutes that duel that

991
0:39:31,279 --> 0:39:03,230
we were talking about casemiro is chasing is

992
0:39:32,839 --> 0:39:05,030
symbolizing the match and in the end the

993
0:39:34,880 --> 0:39:07,130
two have been the scorers at the moment

994
0:39:38,599 --> 0:39:10,970
in this real madrid-barça very quick

995
0:39:41,029 --> 0:39:12,660
reaction of the team  from luis enrique to the

996
0:39:43,279 --> 0:39:14,520
goal scored by casemiro yes madrid

997
0:39:45,890 --> 0:39:16,980
has an advantage that casemiro has scored

998
0:39:46,969 --> 0:39:19,650
but as we see the

999
0:39:48,680 --> 0:39:22,990
game christians can contribute things

1000
0:39:51,819 --> 0:39:25,920
because they are very well placed

1001
0:39:54,380 --> 0:39:28,339
móvi  l and from behind it surprises but on the

1002
0:39:56,930 --> 0:39:31,279
part of barça we see everyone

1003
0:39:58,940 --> 0:39:32,839
quite thick

1004
0:40:02,739 --> 0:39:34,880
difficult care so that he reaches the

1005
0:40:05,059 --> 0:39:38,599
ball for iniesta the goal andrés

1006
0:40:06,170 --> 0:39:41,029
iniesta

1007
0:40:07,369 --> 0:39:43,279
the ball for luis suárez he had made a

1008
0:40:10,460 --> 0:39:45,890
mistake in the ball out sergio

1009
0:40:12,529 --> 0:39:46,969
ramos

1010
0:40:14,090 --> 0:39:48,680
when here we see the goal of  barça and

1011
0:40:16,550 --> 0:39:51,819
luis suárez's drag but

1012
0:40:18,290 --> 0:39:54,380
above all the control that a month ago and

1013
0:40:20,660 --> 0:39:56,930
is dribbling and also as we have said we

1014
0:40:23,180 --> 0:39:58,940
must highlight luis suárez who is

1015
0:40:24,560 --> 0:40:02,739
well understood in the uruguayan

1016
0:40:26,380 --> 0:40:05,059
knew that by letting the ball pass

1017
0:40:29,110 --> 0:40:06,170
leo would arrive and he has  left a ball with that

1018
0:40:32,590 --> 0:40:07,369
movement without touching the ball

1019
0:40:34,170 --> 0:40:10,460
spectacular for leo messi but of course

1020
0:40:36,220 --> 0:40:12,529
then the rest has been done by leo messi at

1021
0:40:38,410 --> 0:40:14,090
a level that seems easy but I can

1022
0:40:41,650 --> 0:40:16,550
say that it is very difficult at that

1023
0:40:43,510 --> 0:40:18,290
speed and with the opponents in

1024
0:40:46,600 --> 0:40:20,660
front of you he has returned  al barça la

1025
0:40:49,330 --> 0:40:23,180
liga

1026
0:40:50,280 --> 0:40:24,560
[Applause]

1027
0:40:53,440 --> 0:40:26,380
wrong in the pass luis suárez for leo

1028
0:40:56,140 --> 0:40:29,110
messi but

1029
0:40:59,890 --> 0:40:32,590
balls in the ball out revealed

1030
0:41:02,170 --> 0:40:34,170
and also the importance of leo

1031
0:41:05,020 --> 0:40:36,220
messi's goal so close to  he goal from real

1032
0:41:07,060 --> 0:40:38,410
madrid allows him to continue gaining

1033
0:41:10,780 --> 0:40:41,650
confidence in us and fc ar form by losing

1034
0:41:13,300 --> 0:40:43,510
the not that has allowed us to be in

1035
0:41:15,880 --> 0:40:46,600
the game again and generate well it's in

1036
0:41:17,890 --> 0:40:49,330
security

1037
0:41:21,870 --> 0:40:50,280
Cristiano

1038
0:41:24,400 --> 0:40:53,440
Cristiano who came out on the line d

1039
0:41:27,280 --> 0:40:56,140
[Applause

1040
0:41:31,890 --> 0:40:59,890
] high up with  this

1041
0:41:35,579 --> 0:41:02,170
save by luka modric's missile if apart from his

1042
0:41:38,430 --> 0:41:05,020
leg discomfort a spectacular shot

1043
0:41:40,640 --> 0:41:07,060
to be the german goalkeeper is also a

1044
0:41:42,900 --> 0:41:10,780
very attentive goalkeeper but i already commented

1045
0:41:45,239 --> 0:41:13,300
before madrid has many aspects

1046
0:41:48,239 --> 0:41:15,880
many options that can create

1047
0:41:50,059 --> 0:41:17,890
danger in today's game

1048
0:41:52,670 --> 0:41:21,870
problems for gareth bale in the left ankle

1049
0:42:00,950 --> 0:41:24,400
because I don't know what will be better or what will be

1050
0:42:02,630 --> 0:41:27,280
worse if it could be a twin

1051
0:42:05,599 --> 0:41:31,890
being on the ground

1052
0:42:07,010 --> 0:41:35,579
remember that today was the day of the return

1053
0:42:08,780 --> 0:41:38,430
of mail that he had retired with

1054
0:42:11,210 --> 0:41:40,640
discomfort in munich he did not play the

1055
0:42:13,369 --> 0:41:42,900
match  back today I went back to gareth bale and

1056
0:42:16,910 --> 0:41:45,239
we are going to see if the

1057
0:42:19,460 --> 0:41:48,239
problem that the Welshman has right now has consequences

1058
0:42:22,130 --> 0:41:50,059
this is the goal of real madrid 1-0

1059
0:42:25,250 --> 0:41:52,670
with that ball from sergio ramos to the post

1060
0:42:29,710 --> 0:41:55,709
and casemiro's subsequent shot as

1061
0:42:33,849 --> 0:42:00,950
the defense of the game that

1062
0:42:35,740 --> 0:42:02,630
stares at both sergio ramos' shot

1063
0:42:37,960 --> 0:42:05,599
and then casemiro's second move we

1064
0:42:41,109 --> 0:42:07,010
don't see it here all the players

1065
0:42:43,119 --> 0:42:08,780
play with the triplet they come out without looking without

1066
0:42:45,760 --> 0:42:11,210
looking at the real madrid players  It's not

1067
0:42:47,740 --> 0:42:13,369
just looking at the ball that's where they

1068
0:42:49,960 --> 0:42:16,910
make the mistake. Take advantage, as Rubén has said,

1069
0:42:53,020 --> 0:42:19,460
it seems very poorly defended,

1070
0:42:55,150 --> 0:42:22,130
but they are the most difficult plays to

1071
0:42:57,460 --> 0:42:25,250
defend when there is a rebound and there is a

1072
0:42:59,980 --> 0:42:29,710
second option that catches you going out into

1073
0:43:01,720 --> 0:42:33,849
the area to get the players out.  players

1074
0:43:05,440 --> 0:42:35,740
or leave the opposing team offside

1075
0:43:06,730 --> 0:42:37,960
people count down how

1076
0:43:08,920 --> 0:42:41,109
they entered Cristiano Ronaldo is chosen

1077
0:43:11,170 --> 0:42:43,119
it is the most difficult thing to defend from here

1078
0:43:14,260 --> 0:42:45,760
Messi's penalty shot was

1079
0:43:16,089 --> 0:42:47,740
very simple and above

1080
0:43:18,880 --> 0:42:49,960
all control when  luka modric overcomes

1081
0:43:20,859 --> 0:42:53,020
that gives him the life

1082
0:43:23,190 --> 0:42:55,150
of

1083
0:43:25,190 --> 0:42:57,460
facing carvajal one on one because

1084
0:43:27,319 --> 0:42:59,980
I think gareth bale is not going to be able to

1085
0:43:28,880 --> 0:43:01,720
continue and the feeling he gave that he

1086
0:43:30,980 --> 0:43:05,440
was m  I have seen arches themselves and so coming

1087
0:43:33,200 --> 0:43:06,730
to the bench is going to be the

1088
0:43:35,270 --> 0:43:08,920
replacement option for real madrid it is going to

1089
0:43:38,660 --> 0:43:11,170
decide in society it is clear that I am not

1090
0:43:40,730 --> 0:43:14,260
happy about the injury to anyone this is a

1091
0:43:42,920 --> 0:43:16,089
strong stick or I will pay after so much

1092
0:43:44,540 --> 0:43:18,880
time  stopped but I think that Madrid will

1093
0:43:46,490 --> 0:43:20,859
benefit from this

1094
0:43:48,260 --> 0:43:23,190
change and another that ascension is the

1095
0:43:49,940 --> 0:43:25,190
player much more in shape

1096
0:43:52,260 --> 0:43:27,319
is that he has an opportunity to

1097
0:43:54,840 --> 0:43:28,880
take advantage of it he

1098
0:43:55,830 --> 0:43:30,980
will be a player that Barça will

1099
0:43:57,300 --> 0:43:33,200
have to take into account mole  later,

1100
0:43:59,670 --> 0:43:35,270
although it no longer has to do with the

1101
0:44:01,320 --> 0:43:38,660
game, but the consequences that

1102
0:44:02,880 --> 0:43:40,730
gareth bale may have for the remainder of the

1103
0:44:04,170 --> 0:43:42,920
season, which is nothing, were minimal

1104
0:44:06,380 --> 0:43:44,540
[Applause]

1105
0:44:08,570 --> 0:43:46,490
the solutions of the champions

1106
0:44:10,220 --> 0:43:48,260
[Applause]

1107
0:44:18,400 --> 0:43:49,940
entrance on Cristiano while he is

1108
0:44:20,380 --> 0:43:52,260
testing the ascension mark and  the yellow one is

1109
0:44:21,849 --> 0:43:54,840
going to arrive

1110
0:44:23,380 --> 0:43:55,830
at the beginning the long one let the

1111
0:44:25,869 --> 0:43:57,300
game continue but the moments of the assistant

1112
0:44:29,170 --> 0:43:59,670
who is the one who communicates to him because there I

1113
0:44:31,000 --> 0:44:01,320
see it as the age with him is how he

1114
0:44:33,790 --> 0:44:02,880
got up to his assistant is when  or compete

1115
0:44:37,000 --> 0:44:04,170
the foul and get the yellow card in

1116
0:44:38,680 --> 0:44:06,380
front of you if it is correct because it is a marmoset

1117
0:44:42,520 --> 0:44:08,570
Cristiano Ronaldo hits and not the ball

1118
0:44:44,440 --> 0:44:10,220
[Applause]

1119
0:44:49,850 --> 0:44:18,400
option covers it seeing nothing Cristiano and there is

1120
0:44:52,970 --> 0:44:20,380
contact and a clear foul between Bitter

1121
0:44:55,460 --> 0:44:21,849
Asensio the change in Real Madrid one

1122
0:44:57,170 --> 0:44:23,380
of fashionable men marked ascension

1123
0:44:59,390 --> 0:44:25,869
well here we see that perhaps because

1124
0:45:02,120 --> 0:44:29,170
coaches sometimes take risks

1125
0:45:04,220 --> 0:44:31,000
the risks that a player is not one

1126
0:45:06,170 --> 0:44:33,790
hundred percent but still decides to

1127
0:45:08,960 --> 0:44:37,000
remove him not simply because of his mere

1128
0:45:10,700 --> 0:44:38,680
presence what it can mean

1129
0:45:12,110 --> 0:44:42,520
to the team and that is what has happened

1130
0:45:14,210 --> 0:44:44,440
with gareth bale de zidane he has decided

1131
0:45:16,790 --> 0:44:47,880
even without being one hundred percent because he

1132
0:45:19,430 --> 0:44:49,850
had to leave the game bad

1133
0:45:21,690 --> 0:44:52,970
luck in the sense that he has

1134
0:45:24,539 --> 0:44:55,460
relapsed from the injury there is no chance

1135
0:45:27,269 --> 0:44:57,170
to be  for asensio for marco asensio

1136
0:45:29,369 --> 0:44:59,390
how good these last few games when he

1137
0:45:31,920 --> 0:45:02,120
has started as a starter or when he has come out

1138
0:45:33,630 --> 0:45:04,220
in a second half for an

1139
0:45:36,269 --> 0:45:06,170
extraordinary performance and level

1140
0:45:38,489 --> 0:45:08,960
I personally like it more  the

1141
0:45:40,109 --> 0:45:10,700
puck option because he is a much older player, despite his

1142
0:45:42,450 --> 0:45:12,110
youth, much more

1143
0:45:44,459 --> 0:45:14,210
prepared for a match of this type

1144
0:45:46,380 --> 0:45:16,790
but well, you also have to respect

1145
0:45:48,479 --> 0:45:19,430
zidane and asensio has not shown that he

1146
0:45:51,539 --> 0:45:21,690
has spectacular nerve and bravado

1147
0:45:52,979 --> 0:45:24,539
and why is he not going  to be another

1148
0:45:55,349 --> 0:45:27,269
day 20 to the ball leo messi ball for

1149
0:45:57,749 --> 0:45:29,369
luis suárez in the film it has served

1150
0:45:59,190 --> 0:45:31,920
visual does not indicate anything the referee luis

1151
0:46:01,630 --> 0:45:33,630
suárez will deliver leo messi messi for

1152
0:46:03,849 --> 0:45:36,269
suárez made short he arrives to see if he arrives

1153
0:46:06,730 --> 0:45:38,489
to see if he can be

1154
0:46:08,780 --> 0:45:40,109
[Applause]

1155
0:46:10,240 --> 0:45:42,450
march  If it were

1156
0:46:12,120 --> 0:45:44,459
like that, he asks for

1157
0:46:14,780 --> 0:45:46,380
a free kick

1158
0:46:16,690 --> 0:45:48,479
[Applause]

1159
0:46:20,660 --> 0:45:51,539
if everyone from Barça

1160
0:46:23,490 --> 0:45:52,979
knows nothing about Leo Messi and they know that he has to

1161
0:46:25,230 --> 0:45:55,349
be the one who participates in all the

1162
0:46:26,580 --> 0:45:57,749
plays and we even see him with plaster on

1163
0:46:29,100 --> 0:45:59,190
his mouth that's incredible it seems but

1164
0:46:33,710 --> 0:46:01,630
a  little psychologically you can get

1165
0:46:36,270 --> 0:46:03,849
the game by having to bite all that

1166
0:46:38,220 --> 0:46:06,730
at all times but but leo messi it is

1167
0:46:41,190 --> 0:46:08,780
very difficult to stop it no matter how

1168
0:46:44,640 --> 0:46:10,240
difficult you put it,

1169
0:46:46,830 --> 0:46:12,120
the players protest because there is

1170
0:46:48,690 --> 0:46:14,780
and  Indeed, from his corner a wide

1171
0:46:50,790 --> 0:46:16,690
had cleared Leo Messi's shot

1172
0:46:53,730 --> 0:46:20,660
and I have the importance in each play in

1173
0:46:56,700 --> 0:46:23,490
each second each moment of the game

1174
0:46:59,880 --> 0:46:25,230
how this classic sergi roberto is living

1175
0:47:02,519 --> 0:46:26,580
41 minutes first part it seems

1176
0:47:04,740 --> 0:46:29,100
very short this we are about to

1177
0:47:07,910 --> 0:46:33,710
to arrive at the break

1178
0:47:08,920 --> 0:46:36,270
a marmoset andrés iniesta the control

1179
0:47:11,749 --> 0:46:38,220
oriented to the leaves for sergio Busquets

1180
0:47:13,749 --> 0:46:41,190
delays for samuel before you this one with

1181
0:47:16,309 --> 0:46:44,640
andrés iniesta the 8th from spain al

1182
0:47:18,950 --> 0:46:46,830
manchego handles the ball sends to the

1183
0:47:20,749 --> 0:46:48,690
right for sergi roberto arriving at the

1184
0:47:24,200 --> 0:46:50,790
dividing line brakes series roberto via  For

1185
0:47:26,390 --> 0:46:53,730
Gerard Piqué

1186
0:47:28,150 --> 0:46:56,700
and for Sergio Busquets, they seek to

1187
0:47:30,069 --> 0:46:59,880
follow

1188
0:47:31,260 --> 0:47:02,519
Busquets, who delivers to the right over

1189
0:47:33,640 --> 0:47:04,740
again. Sergi Roberto will

1190
0:47:36,000 --> 0:47:07,910
withdraw Real Madrid for the time being

1191
0:47:37,930 --> 0:47:08,920
while the glass continues to have a

1192
0:47:39,099 --> 0:47:11,749
Rakitic concession, if Busquets, Barça

1193
0:47:41,770 --> 0:47:13,749
will touch at that point always and at

1194
0:47:44,500 --> 0:47:16,309
all times.  trying

1195
0:47:46,480 --> 0:47:18,950
to get messi to appear to overcome lines we see that there is

1196
0:47:48,819 --> 0:47:20,749
trying not to lose until they have the

1197
0:47:50,799 --> 0:47:24,200
chance to give the ball to al

1198
0:47:52,750 --> 0:47:26,390
number 10 while there is no other player

1199
0:47:54,819 --> 0:47:28,150
to give options in the final meters

1200
0:47:57,180 --> 0:47:30,069
the ball ends in the goalkeeper at ter

1201
0:48:00,400 --> 0:47:31,260
stegen sends gerard piqué to sergi

1202
0:48:02,650 --> 0:47:33,640
roberto la vida iván rakitic goes

1203
0:48:05,680 --> 0:47:36,000
there from afar casemiro

1204
0:48:08,269 --> 0:47:37,930
before

1205
0:48:11,910 --> 0:47:39,099
the pressure on the goalkeeper forces him to

1206
0:48:14,549 --> 0:47:41,770
hit the long ball  luis suárez jumps and

1207
0:48:16,440 --> 0:47:44,500
sergio ramos takes it to toni kroos

1208
0:48:18,000 --> 0:47:46,480
who puts them a great pass for

1209
0:48:20,309 --> 0:47:48,819
marcelo the brazilian marcelo joins,

1210
0:48:22,799 --> 0:47:50,799
poking the ball but with his chest he

1211
0:48:26,039 --> 0:47:52,750
lowers it and they cut samuel on marmoset who

1212
0:48:28,319 --> 0:47:54,819
applies it with that quality for 3 iniesta

1213
0:48:31,069 --> 0:47:57,180
leads the  manchego andrés iniesta enters

1214
0:48:33,450 --> 0:48:00,400
for leo messi messi now leaning

1215
0:48:35,760 --> 0:48:02,650
on the right side messi filtered

1216
0:48:38,549 --> 0:48:05,680
for the viewer i'm out of the game

1217
0:48:39,839 --> 0:48:08,269
life

1218
0:48:45,460 --> 0:48:11,910
pressured by marco ascension ends

1219
0:48:50,080 --> 0:48:14,549
up on the right of keylor navas work was done in

1220
0:48:52,840 --> 0:48:16,440
asencio's defense it was essential

1221
0:48:54,730 --> 0:48:18,000
because the center of visuals was

1222
0:48:56,650 --> 0:48:20,309
great for jordi alba's arrival

1223
0:48:59,200 --> 0:48:22,799
at the far post after

1224
0:49:00,610 --> 0:48:26,039
paco alcácer's move to the near post and that

1225
0:49:03,040 --> 0:48:28,319
defensive work by asencio has  It was

1226
0:49:04,870 --> 0:48:31,069
essential for me to

1227
0:49:07,140 --> 0:48:33,450
finish off with total comfort

1228
0:49:10,920 --> 0:48:35,760
I went back it would have been a

1229
0:49:14,430 --> 0:48:38,549
better option for the shot We have a

1230
0:49:17,040 --> 0:48:39,839
second where there were already two

1231
0:49:18,420 --> 0:48:45,460
Real Madrid players, each of

1232
0:49:20,069 --> 0:48:50,080
Casemiro Sergio Busquets is missing on

1233
0:49:22,950 --> 0:48:52,840
Casemiro Final stretch of the first half

1234
0:49:25,770 --> 0:48:54,730
We are about to reach the  rest

1235
0:49:27,410 --> 0:48:56,650
with the tie for gold first casemiro

1236
0:49:30,060 --> 0:48:59,200
then leo messi here we see the

1237
0:49:33,030 --> 0:49:00,610
unchecking of payment to which to do back he

1238
0:49:34,740 --> 0:49:03,040
would have received totally alone

1239
0:49:36,960 --> 0:49:04,870
totally alone and there paco moves very

1240
0:49:40,230 --> 0:49:07,140
well those tricks inside the ball area

1241
0:49:44,250 --> 0:49:10,920
for toni kross luis enrique was hoarse

1242
0:49:46,020 --> 0:49:14,430
he said alone  bus and I think

1243
0:49:48,510 --> 0:49:17,040
that even to make this link before

1244
0:49:50,340 --> 0:49:18,420
we had the possibility we will go

1245
0:49:51,960 --> 0:49:20,069
short instead of hitting long

1246
0:49:53,990 --> 0:49:22,950
nacho ball for carlos enrique casemiro

1247
0:49:58,310 --> 0:49:25,770
we reach 44 casemiro's change of game

1248
0:50:00,170 --> 0:49:27,410
is not a good ball but

1249
0:50:02,180 --> 0:49:30,060
neither is the clearance  by ivan rakitic

1250
0:50:05,770 --> 0:49:33,030
throw-in for real madrid the

1251
0:50:08,480 --> 0:49:34,740
image of cristiano ronaldo from more to

1252
0:50:10,310 --> 0:49:36,960
less in the first half started very

1253
0:50:12,800 --> 0:49:40,230
put in it for a long time we haven't seen the ball

1254
0:50:15,980 --> 0:49:44,250
for modric you challenge it casemiro the

1255
0:50:19,700 --> 0:49:46,020
midfielder delivers to the right for

1256
0:50:21,260 --> 0:49:48,510
danny carvajal Cristiano comes to receive

1257
0:50:23,060 --> 0:49:50,340
but carvajal wanted to put it in

1258
0:50:24,380 --> 0:49:51,960
depth recovers barça andrés

1259
0:50:26,630 --> 0:49:53,990
iniesta with paco alcácer he makes a mistake in

1260
0:50:29,780 --> 0:49:58,310
expansion because real madrid fast

1261
0:50:32,890 --> 0:50:00,170
for

1262
0:50:34,940 --> 0:50:02,180
asensio barcelona and returns to recover

1263
0:50:38,150 --> 0:50:05,770
luis enrique's team

1264
0:50:40,710 --> 0:50:08,480
to get jordi alba you have to see the

1265
0:50:44,160 --> 0:50:10,310
added time that is probably a

1266
0:50:46,560 --> 0:50:12,800
minute for the time he has had to

1267
0:50:48,210 --> 0:50:15,980
be attended leo messi sergio ramos

1268
0:50:52,260 --> 0:50:19,700
reaches the entire division the captain of

1269
0:50:55,560 --> 0:50:21,260
madrid  puts it to the right for marko

1270
0:50:57,150 --> 0:50:23,060
asensio control of asensio and the fight

1271
0:51:00,210 --> 0:50:24,380
with paco alcácer there is marco asensio

1272
0:51:03,000 --> 0:50:26,630
delivery for luka modric modric with the

1273
0:51:05,490 --> 0:50:29,780
ball modestly endures and never

1274
0:51:08,220 --> 0:50:32,890
modestly with the left that

1275
0:51:09,720 --> 0:50:34,940
danger always had on benzema he

1276
0:51:12,330 --> 0:50:38,150
takes it out with Busquets quality  andrés iniesta

1277
0:51:13,680 --> 0:50:40,710
malla discharge of the visuals danger

1278
0:51:15,350 --> 0:50:44,160
attention to leo messi messi wants to remove

1279
0:51:18,870 --> 0:50:46,560
messi right  ima prison million

1280
0:51:20,400 --> 0:50:48,210
that leo messi

1281
0:51:21,590 --> 0:50:52,260
jumps from casemiro over leo messi

1282
0:51:26,799 --> 0:50:55,560
to ask for the second from the brazilian if

1283
0:51:29,410 --> 0:50:57,150
we see the whole barça team

1284
0:51:31,089 --> 0:51:00,210
protesting and it is not that it is a foul

1285
0:51:33,999 --> 0:51:03,000
with intensity or in bad faith but

1286
0:51:36,910 --> 0:51:05,490
a counterattack is being cut let's say

1287
0:51:39,130 --> 0:51:08,220
very dangerous  madrid- we see how he

1288
0:51:41,439 --> 0:51:09,720
steps on leo messi's left foot there and

1289
0:51:45,699 --> 0:51:12,330
what his fc barcelona teammates are protesting

1290
0:51:47,709 --> 0:51:13,680
is not outrageous

1291
0:51:49,660 --> 0:51:15,350
because it was a clear opportunity

1292
0:51:51,980 --> 0:51:18,870
for fc barcelona and we see that

1293
0:51:53,750 --> 0:51:20,400
even messi himself is asking for it for my

1294
0:51:56,030 --> 0:51:21,590
second yellow card  for songbook

1295
0:51:58,190 --> 0:51:26,799
and expulsions and casemiro is playing

1296
0:52:00,859 --> 0:51:29,410
with fire he is playing with fire because

1297
0:52:02,750 --> 0:51:31,089
messi is there he is a player who

1298
0:52:06,170 --> 0:51:33,999
feels he dribbles he is going to dribble you there he does not

1299
0:52:07,880 --> 0:51:36,910
have to enter casemiro there we see how

1300
0:52:09,650 --> 0:51:39,130
he steps on him and that is why his career is not

1301
0:52:12,910 --> 0:51:41,439
missing from barça iván  rakitic cleared

1302
0:52:15,380 --> 0:51:45,699
sergio ramos at the edge of the area

1303
0:52:16,609 --> 0:51:47,709
marked asensio passing roberto

1304
0:52:19,020 --> 0:51:49,660
to christian ronaldo at the end

1305
0:52:21,660 --> 0:51:51,980
211 men were added for jordi alba delivery for

1306
0:52:24,510 --> 0:51:53,750
andré  s iniesta iniesta advances meters with the ball

1307
0:52:26,390 --> 0:51:56,030
andrés iniesta

1308
0:52:28,620 --> 0:51:58,190
returns it to him sergio Busquets again

1309
0:52:30,180 --> 0:52:00,859
andrés iniesta 30 seconds to

1310
0:52:32,550 --> 0:52:02,750
rest big

1311
0:52:37,900 --> 0:52:06,170
nacho because as soon as he touched the

1312
0:52:40,250 --> 0:52:07,880
ball he threw himself to the ground something

1313
0:52:43,370 --> 0:52:09,650
nacho noticed when the ball

1314
0:52:45,860 --> 0:52:12,910
hit him and he  let's see here

1315
0:52:47,390 --> 0:52:15,380
right away the image

1316
0:52:49,100 --> 0:52:16,609
[Applause] he

1317
0:52:51,569 --> 0:52:19,020
makes a knock down supported with his knee

1318
0:52:54,119 --> 0:52:21,660
stretched out

1319
0:52:56,390 --> 0:52:24,510
we'll see there we see the play as how

1320
0:52:59,329 --> 0:52:26,390
piqué says things to

1321
0:53:02,089 --> 0:52:28,620
sting casemiro there and a duel in which everything everything

1322
0:53:05,029 --> 0:52:30,180
is within everyone's reach to

1323
0:53:07,890 --> 0:52:32,550
win a minimum

1324
0:53:10,289 --> 0:52:37,900
the tremendous image of psyche

1325
0:53:12,630 --> 0:52:40,250
telling noise in casimiro that

1326
0:53:16,230 --> 0:52:43,370
rakitic was smiling corner kick to pass a

1327
0:53:19,460 --> 0:52:45,860
foul on keylor

1328
0:53:20,550 --> 0:52:47,390
[Applause]

1329
0:53:22,850 --> 0:52:49,100
later leo messi had finished off alone

1330
0:53:25,970 --> 0:52:51,569
and had kicked the argentinian out

1331
0:53:28,690 --> 0:52:54,119
and again the idea appears after leo

1332
0:53:30,760 --> 0:52:56,390
messi and we see that  there he is

1333
0:53:33,369 --> 0:52:59,329
protesting

1334
0:53:34,410 --> 0:53:02,089
that the navas the truth is that there is

1335
0:53:37,780 --> 0:53:05,029
minimal contact but I think it's missing

1336
0:53:40,030 --> 0:53:07,890
because inside the area you can't even

1337
0:53:42,010 --> 0:53:10,289
touch the goalkeeper we see that here  he

1338
0:53:44,380 --> 0:53:12,630
sticks his arm out a little

1339
0:53:46,420 --> 0:53:14,669
is that nothing can be done inside the area

1340
0:53:48,099 --> 0:53:16,230
the goalkeeper is missing the first

1341
0:53:50,109 --> 0:53:19,460
half ends the barça players

1342
0:53:51,339 --> 0:53:20,550
protesting asking for that

1343
0:53:53,049 --> 0:53:22,850
yellow card the second for casemiro who has

1344
0:53:54,849 --> 0:53:25,970
been very prominent in the positive in

1345
0:53:58,240 --> 0:53:28,690
the goal and then also for  those

1346
0:54:00,280 --> 0:53:30,760
actions to the limit quick summary

1347
0:54:02,530 --> 0:53:33,369
first part rubén a

1348
0:54:04,869 --> 0:53:34,410
very vibrant first part very exciting the two

1349
0:54:07,720 --> 0:53:37,780
teams have played attack we have seen

1350
0:54:09,400 --> 0:53:40,030
many chances by both

1351
0:54:11,680 --> 0:53:42,010
teams maybe a little more by

1352
0:54:13,030 --> 0:53:44,380
realmadrid and then

1353
0:54:16,299 --> 0:53:46,420
casemiro's decisive action that

1354
0:54:18,670 --> 0:53:48,099
possibly  it could have been the

1355
0:54:20,079 --> 0:53:50,109
second yellow card, penalty,

1356
0:54:21,940 --> 0:53:51,339
minute two in favor of real madrid' which

1357
0:54:24,520 --> 0:53:53,049
I think is for me a marmoset from above

1358
0:54:26,020 --> 0:53:54,849
Cristiano Ronaldo in the area that is not

1359
0:54:27,579 --> 0:53:58,240
called but even so I think the

1360
0:54:29,319 --> 0:54:00,280
referee is doing a good job and  a

1361
0:54:31,720 --> 0:54:02,530
very even game albert

1362
0:54:33,460 --> 0:54:04,869
luque summary well it is clear that madrid has

1363
0:54:36,640 --> 0:54:07,720
been a little better

1364
0:54:38,400 --> 0:54:09,400
two very different ways above all

1365
0:54:40,619 --> 0:54:11,680
madrid because the

1366
0:54:42,869 --> 0:54:13,030
whole team goes out at the same time and on the part of

1367
0:54:44,880 --> 0:54:16,299
barça always looking for the presence of

1368
0:54:47,400 --> 0:54:18,670
leo messi who is the one who leads the whole

1369
0:54:48,900 --> 0:54:20,079
attack of barça and this second part

1370
0:54:51,750 --> 0:54:21,940
because the two coaches have many

1371
0:54:54,839 --> 0:54:24,520
things to say to  his teams and above

1372
0:54:56,609 --> 0:54:26,020
all, be careful with Casimiro who is not one of them,

1373
0:54:59,250 --> 0:54:27,579
he has earned this second

1374
0:55:00,960 --> 0:54:29,319
yellow card and he is going to have to be very

1375
0:55:03,180 --> 0:54:31,720
careful not to finish, he will end up being sent off

1376
0:55:05,250 --> 0:54:33,460
in today's

1377
0:55:06,720 --> 0:54:36,640
game luxury commentator luxury match at the bernabéu real

1378
0:55:08,640 --> 0:54:38,400
madrid-  casemiro 1 barça leo messi 1

1379
0:56:15,630 --> 0:54:40,619
time off in the Clásico at the

santiago bernabéu stadium image of

1381
0:56:19,960 --> 0:54:44,880
the real madrid players- remember by the

1382
0:56:22,029 --> 0:54:47,400
way that the white team saw

1383
0:56:25,150 --> 0:54:48,900
how gareth bale had to leave

1384
0:56:27,489 --> 0:54:51,750
injured in the first half he came on in

1385
0:56:30,130 --> 0:54:54,839
his place  he scored asensio was the only

1386
0:56:32,859 --> 0:54:56,609
change in timing of the match the only

1387
0:56:35,950 --> 0:54:59,250
change in the white team and image of

1388
0:56:39,430 --> 0:55:00,960
the barça captain andrés iniesta

1389
0:56:41,259 --> 0:55:03,180
very competitive first half is the  current real

1390
0:56:43,180 --> 0:55:05,250
madrid with a goal from casemiro leo

1391
0:56:44,799 --> 0:55:06,720
messi raised and from now on gentlemen of

1392
0:56:47,499 --> 0:55:08,640
the network and luque

1393
0:56:48,759 --> 0:56:15,630
well let's hope they continue to give us

1394
0:56:51,069 --> 0:56:18,069
the show that fractioned us in this

1395
0:56:53,829 --> 0:56:19,960
first half

1396
0:56:55,180 --> 0:56:22,029
a tremendously exciting game very

1397
0:56:58,089 --> 0:56:25,150
good by both teams perhaps

1398
0:57:00,460 --> 0:56:27,489
real madrid has been a little

1399
0:57:02,019 --> 0:56:30,130
more superior than club barcelona but

1400
0:57:05,009 --> 0:56:32,859
chances on the part of both teams

1401
0:57:06,759 --> 0:56:35,950
good game

1402
0:57:09,250 --> 0:56:39,430
there hasn't been much tangle either tangle

1403
0:57:12,250 --> 0:56:41,259
with controversial plays or

1404
0:57:14,340 --> 0:56:43,180
ugly situations during the game but on

1405
0:57:16,840 --> 0:56:44,799
the contrary i was watching

1406
0:57:19,170 --> 0:56:47,499
a pretty good game  well and the match that

1407
0:57:22,589 --> 0:56:48,759
is even we will see which of the

1408
0:57:24,329 --> 0:56:51,069
two teams is the one that achieves singles

1409
0:57:26,549 --> 0:56:53,829
see it well yes according to rubén that

1410
0:57:29,010 --> 0:56:55,180
the match is very even

1411
0:57:31,269 --> 0:56:58,089
I think that madrid is going to come out with the

1412
0:57:33,999 --> 0:57:00,460
rhythm of the game that has come out in  he at the

1413
0:57:36,309 --> 0:57:02,019
beginning of the game putting barça

1414
0:57:39,609 --> 0:57:05,009
in their own field and he hoped that this

1415
0:57:41,859 --> 0:57:06,759
barça would

1416
0:57:44,470 --> 0:57:09,250
come out with a much higher pace in this second half than

1417
0:57:47,050 --> 0:57:12,250
game and from the beginning make it more

1418
0:57:48,970 --> 0:57:14,340
difficult for real madrid to see a

1419
0:57:51,510 --> 0:57:16,840
much more active real madrid-barcelona

1420
0:57:55,599 --> 0:57:19,170
from the beginning dies with a detail that is

1421
0:57:58,330 --> 0:57:22,589
also very important that must be

1422
0:57:59,470 --> 0:57:24,329
taken into account this tie is not worth it

1423
0:58:01,540 --> 0:57:26,549
for barça if they really want to win the

1424
0:58:03,310 --> 0:57:29,010
league  Barça has to go for the

1425
0:58:05,080 --> 0:57:31,269
victory, they have to take risks and with

1426
0:58:07,900 --> 0:57:33,999
that they can also manage the

1427
0:58:09,760 --> 0:57:36,309
match, for example Real Madrid

1428
0:58:11,710 --> 0:57:39,609
we are seeing Leo Messi who knows that

1429
0:58:14,830 --> 0:57:41,859
in the first half he suffered a

1430
0:58:16,359 --> 0:57:44,470
very hard blow

1431
0:58:17,590 --> 0:57:47,050
with his elbow that he caused  that

1432
0:58:21,809 --> 0:57:48,970
the mouth bled well in the first part but it

1433
0:58:25,349 --> 0:57:51,510
seems that this bleeding is more or

1434
0:58:27,119 --> 0:57:55,599
less controlled and

1435
0:58:28,739 --> 0:57:58,330
the Argentine game does not even need the gauze anymore, which has been

1436
0:58:30,749 --> 0:57:59,470
very protagonist in the first part that

1437
0:58:33,689 --> 0:58:01,540
has scored the goal for barça and has been the

1438
0:58:35,849 --> 0:58:03,310
man  decisive for the azulgrana team and

1439
0:58:37,319 --> 0:58:05,080
here is what zidane is saying to

1440
0:58:39,180 --> 0:58:07,900
carlos enrique camino for sure that he is

1441
0:58:41,369 --> 0:58:09,760
intelligent that he takes whatever seniority

1442
0:58:45,239 --> 0:58:11,710
he may have and that he is ready to go  when it

1443
0:58:47,430 --> 0:58:14,830
comes to cutting plays when it comes to

1444
0:58:50,759 --> 0:58:16,359
entering anyone

1445
0:58:54,090 --> 0:58:17,590
one on one that messi and

1446
0:58:56,580 --> 0:58:20,170
iniesta face or any player from barça

1447
0:58:58,710 --> 0:58:21,809
than leaving him with 10 players to his team

1448
0:59:01,200 --> 0:58:25,349
against fc barcelona the

1449
0:59:04,320 --> 0:58:27,119
minutes are very long beautiful image of

1450
0:59:07,440 --> 0:58:28,739
the santiago bernabéu stadium o  aerial image

1451
0:59:09,300 --> 0:58:30,749
that precedes the start of the second

1452
0:59:12,420 --> 0:58:33,689
half with the ball for fc barcelona

1453
0:59:17,940 --> 0:58:35,849
sergio Busquets first

1454
0:59:21,500 --> 0:58:37,319
second half the longer the working day

1455
0:59:23,330 --> 0:58:39,180
we are in you when with gerard

1456
0:59:27,579 --> 0:58:41,369
piqué luís siever's team that captures the

1457
0:59:29,049 --> 0:58:45,239
santiago bernabéu stadium

1458
0:59:31,140 --> 0:58:47,430
to the white fans a marmoset receiving

1459
0:59:33,849 --> 0:58:50,759
from  Buscats a typical of all the calm

1460
0:59:36,170 --> 0:58:54,090
of

1461
0:59:37,619 --> 0:58:56,580
finding a pass that at the moment does not

1462
0:59:39,390 --> 0:58:58,710
appear before you now when with gerard

1463
0:59:42,329 --> 0:59:01,200
piqué the 3 from barça to the right center

1464
0:59:45,960 --> 0:59:04,320
of the team make a delivery for zach and

1465
0:59:47,700 --> 0:59:07,440
roberto pressured by christian ronaldo

1466
0:59:50,380 --> 0:59:09,300
[Applause]

1467
0:59:54,050 --> 0:59:12,420
for samuel otitis and  above all barça

1468
0:59:56,970 --> 0:59:17,940
leaving it would be very important not to be

1469
0:59:59,460 --> 0:59:21,500
surprised because if they got

1470
1:00:01,860 --> 0:59:23,330
behind the scoreboard again they

1471
1:00:04,150 --> 0:59:27,579
have people  let's say that for the last few

1472
1:00:06,010 --> 0:59:29,049
minutes

1473
1:00:07,670 --> 0:59:31,140
he's not fit

1474
1:00:11,569 --> 0:59:33,849
enough to shoot rafinha due to injury and attacking people are

1475
1:00:13,730 --> 0:59:36,170
n't there to be able to

1476
1:00:14,869 --> 0:59:37,619
surprise barça's defense

1477
1:00:16,339 --> 0:59:39,390
so it would be very important for the

1478
1:00:18,260 --> 0:59:42,329
azulgrana group to set a high pace and

1479
1:00:20,660 --> 0:59:45,960
be them  those who surprise

1480
1:00:23,660 --> 0:59:47,700
leaked ball for ivan rakitic if he loses it

1481
1:00:25,609 --> 0:59:50,380
to toni kroos he plays appear or for

1482
1:00:27,530 --> 0:59:54,050
christian this control and cross karim

1483
1:00:30,049 --> 0:59:56,970
benzema left it shortened microphones sergi

1484
1:00:32,900 --> 0:59:59,460
roberto

1485
1:00:34,230 --> 1:00:01,860
the value is for gerard piqué

1486
1:00:36,239 --> 1:00:04,150
between the lines for sergio ramos

1487
1:00:38,879 --> 1:00:06,010
also casemiro leo messi with the ball  he

1488
1:00:41,879 --> 1:00:07,670
lied to luis suárez but casemiro was very

1489
1:00:43,679 --> 1:00:11,569
good cutting off

1490
1:00:47,020 --> 1:00:13,730
the presence that has a great stride

1491
1:00:48,960 --> 1:00:14,869
asensio driving access in love

1492
1:00:51,850 --> 1:00:16,339
within the rod that advances in the

1493
1:00:52,990 --> 1:00:18,260
load center

1494
1:00:56,200 --> 1:00:20,660
[Applause]

1495
1:01:00,280 --> 1:00:23,660
the central culé if this starts again

1496
1:01:02,740 --> 1:00:25,609
like the first part  once again those

1497
1:01:05,260 --> 1:00:27,530
internships of carvajal to cancer

1498
1:01:08,170 --> 1:00:30,049
stays on top and has to hit if that

1499
1:01:10,270 --> 1:00:32,900
sprint leo messi that I think should

1500
1:01:12,280 --> 1:00:34,230
be saved for  ra attacking plays

1501
1:01:13,960 --> 1:00:36,239
because his team needs him a lot and

1502
1:01:15,970 --> 1:00:38,879
we see there that picket rebound that

1503
1:01:17,890 --> 1:00:41,879
could have been a great scare

1504
1:01:20,780 --> 1:00:43,679
leo feels like defending and

1505
1:01:22,370 --> 1:00:47,020
the power of ascension has not arrived in that race

1506
1:01:25,010 --> 1:00:48,960
and then also the accompaniment of

1507
1:01:27,800 --> 1:00:51,850
carvajal we have seen that  they are

1508
1:01:30,830 --> 1:00:52,990
in shape

1509
1:01:32,000 --> 1:00:56,200
[Applause]

1510
1:01:33,210 --> 1:01:00,280
if toni kroos trains set pieces nor

1511
1:01:35,580 --> 1:01:02,740
carvajal carvajal amara with putting the

1512
1:01:38,160 --> 1:01:05,260

brazilian plays on a wide one keeps the

1515
1:01:45,600 --> 1:01:12,280
ball the madridista center-back delivers

1516
1:01:47,280 --> 1:01:13,960
for carvajal pressuring luis suárez he

1517
1:01:49,710 --> 1:01:15,970
raises danny carvajal the ball did not go

1518
1:01:51,240 --> 1:01:17,890
inside the real

1519
1:01:53,850 --> 1:01:20,780
madrid side- good ball on luca modric

1520
1:01:55,290 --> 1:01:22,370
who manages to control the ball he

1521
1:01:57,630 --> 1:01:25,010
put it in for marco asensio he returns the

1522
1:01:59,700 --> 1:01:27,800
ball for danny carvajal who changes the

1523
1:02:02,220 --> 1:01:30,830
game good ball for

1524
1:02:03,670 --> 1:01:32,000

1525
1:02:06,289 --> 1:01:33,210
there it is  marcelo marcelo on the

for madrid and they appeared  do again the

1530
1:02:20,269 --> 1:01:45,600
goalkeeper in charge

1531
1:02:22,510 --> 1:01:47,280
of being hit he loves this was the

1532
1:02:24,490 --> 1:01:49,710
area with the inside looking for a post be

1533
1:02:26,230 --> 1:01:51,240
careful marcelo the second center to

1534
1:02:28,120 --> 1:01:53,850
take off sergio Busquets the ball

1535
1:02:30,640 --> 1:01:55,290
went to the throw-in

1536
1:02:32,740 --> 1:01:57,630
the second half starts again how the

1537
1:02:34,600 --> 1:01:59,700
game started  with madrid attacking if it seems like

1538
1:02:36,640 --> 1:02:02,220
a copy of the beginning of the game,

1539
1:02:39,310 --> 1:02:03,670
barça was able to react in the first

1540
1:02:40,690 --> 1:02:06,289
half but I think that again

1541
1:02:44,710 --> 1:02:08,449
it goes through but I was talking solver I

1542
1:02:46,990 --> 1:02:12,810
say again that yes that is what I asked for

1543
1:02:49,180 --> 1:02:14,390
calm and the team needs to be

1544
1:02:51,040 --> 1:02:17,779
much more

1545
1:02:53,250 --> 1:02:20,269
with much  more liveliness with much more

1546
1:02:55,320 --> 1:02:22,510
intensity because that way the only thing he is going to

1547
1:02:58,020 --> 1:02:24,490
do is bail out water and sooner or later

1548
1:03:01,080 --> 1:02:26,230
the goal is going to come to him he runs from short to

1549
1:03:03,390 --> 1:02:28,120
marcelo very only colic going to come from

1550
1:03:05,160 --> 1:02:30,640
marsans two micros ball out

1551
1:03:09,070 --> 1:02:32,740
of sergio ramos in the area  chica and

1552
1:03:11,890 --> 1:02:34,600
barça conceding a short corner that

1553
1:03:15,400 --> 1:02:36,640
almost allowed cross to get into the

1554
1:03:17,230 --> 1:02:39,310
area

1555
1:03:18,950 --> 1:02:40,690
because i didn't defend the

1556
1:03:22,779 --> 1:02:44,710
captain out of the game from cristiano

1557
1:03:24,489 --> 1:02:46,990
ronaldo

1558
1:03:26,190 --> 1:02:49,180
bad gender  once again

1559
1:03:29,450 --> 1:02:51,040
the game of barcelona

1560
1:03:31,900 --> 1:02:53,250
the attacking action of real madrid the

1561
1:03:33,760 --> 1:02:55,320
fall after ramos with Busquets xavi

1562
1:03:35,650 --> 1:02:58,020
has indicated the referee that

1563
1:03:38,079 --> 1:03:01,080
offside position of Cristiano Little to

1564
1:03:40,119 --> 1:03:03,390
Sergio Busquets

1565
1:03:43,260 --> 1:03:05,160
so the massive natural fall is

1566
1:03:47,280 --> 1:03:09,070
clearly missing and we are going to  See that Busquets

1567
1:03:49,950 --> 1:03:11,890
has nothing in the adductor because

1568
1:03:51,630 --> 1:03:15,400
according to the repetition that in a

1569
1:03:54,900 --> 1:03:17,230
slightly strange way,

1570
1:03:56,960 --> 1:03:18,950
calm hernández hernández to

1571
1:04:00,050 --> 1:03:22,779
Karim Benzema for the hard tackle here on

1572
1:04:04,010 --> 1:03:24,489
Sergio Busquets in the left leg

1573
1:04:07,380 --> 1:03:26,190
the repetition a yellow card

1574
1:04:09,750 --> 1:03:29,450
should not have

1575
1:04:12,119 --> 1:03:31,900
surprised us either  nobody a perfect marmoset the

1576
1:04:15,210 --> 1:03:33,760
record where over marks in 100 the

1577
1:04:17,160 --> 1:03:35,650
whole lane is open jordi alba

1578
1:04:19,250 --> 1:03:38,079

1:04:20,810 --> 1:03:40,119
spanish international delivers for

1581
1:04:24,470 --> 1:03:47,280
deliver it to him and this song

1582
1:04:26,360 --> 1:03:49,950
[Music]

1583
1:04:27,620 --> 1:03:51,630
did not go well for him but

1584
1:04:30,830 --> 1:03:54,900
he was also  invalidated the move due

1585
1:04:32,930 --> 1:03:56,960
to offside of hospitalet

1586
1:04:35,680 --> 1:04:00,050
and we will see it in the repetition action

1587
1:04:38,230 --> 1:04:04,010
of jordi alba with danny  carvajal

1588
1:04:40,430 --> 1:04:07,380
a little ahead very fair but

1589
1:04:43,770 --> 1:04:09,750
we are seeing how the two teams

1590
1:04:45,420 --> 1:04:12,119
are trying to push their

1591
1:04:47,610 --> 1:04:15,210

the ball is going to be lost from

barcelona

1618
1:05:50,320 --> 1:05:19,060
a very complicated pass because it's very

1619
1:05:52,490 --> 1:05:21,080
complicated especially because work

1620
1:05:54,620 --> 1:05:23,240
hadn't arrived there is a tremendous mistake

1621
1:05:56,600 --> 1:05:25,809
by ter stegen or game by real madrid

1622
1:05:58,610 --> 1:05:28,390

1624
1:06:03,500 --> 1:05:32,030
world says that Sergio Busquets can't get in there

1625
1:06:05,590 --> 1:05:34,340
lost

1626
1:06:09,250 --> 1:05:35,960
[Applause]

1627
1:06:12,000 --> 1:05:38,210
interpreting medieval of the mother and

1628
1:06:13,740 --> 1:05:40,730
forced

1629
1:06:15,630 --> 1:05:42,740
to make mistakes in that exit of the ball

1630
1:06:17,910 --> 1:05:45,350
we haven't seen how before 3 peking has

1631
1:06:20,190 --> 1:05:46,880
rushed now of sweets that no  he

1632
1:06:23,260 --> 1:05:49,550
had no way out due to the pressure of

1633
1:06:25,870 --> 1:05:50,320
the three real madrid players

1634
1:06:27,589 --> 1:05:52,490
when dawn had indicated here due

1635
1:06:29,210 --> 1:05:54,620
to a foul by sergio ramos on

1636
1:06:31,039 --> 1:05:56,600
sergio Busquets and it could be that there is a

1637
1:06:33,200 --> 1:05:58,610
little contact with the knees but that

1638
1:06:35,089 --> 1:06:01,160
is when Sergio Busquets has already given the

1639
1:06:37,009 --> 1:06:03,500
pass and even the play was made and for me

1640
1:06:39,680 --> 1:06:05,590
he should

1641
1:06:40,900 --> 1:06:09,250
n't have called a foul and he didn't

1642
1:06:43,180 --> 1:06:12,000
even lose the ball it was due to an error by

1643
1:06:44,590 --> 1:06:13,740
sergio Busquets after the pr

1644
1:06:47,320 --> 1:06:15,630
sergio ramos otesta for hernández hernández

1645
1:06:48,940 --> 1:06:17,910
who read him the primer to try to

1646
1:06:51,940 --> 1:06:20,190
control those protests a bit delivers

1647
1:06:54,700 --> 1:06:23,260
a marmoset seven minutes into the second

1648
1:06:56,080 --> 1:06:25,870
half vain for ter stegen of pressure to

1649
1:06:59,110 --> 1:06:27,589
karim benzema ter stegen delivers the

1650
1:07:00,700 --> 1:06:29,210
ball to sergi roberto the

1651
1:07:02,770 --> 1:06:31,039
ball rises toni  kroos plays with casemiro

1652
1:07:05,320 --> 1:06:33,200
barça is having a hard time getting out toni

1653
1:07:07,750 --> 1:06:35,089
kross crosses his mind for marcelo enabled position

1654
1:07:18,570 --> 1:06:37,009

[Applause]

1656
1:07:25,799 --> 1:06:40,900
and for me wherever he is good with a

1657
1:07:29,400 --> 1:06:43,180
little luck he tried to make it

1658
1:07:31,439 --> 1:06:44,590
big for me cani's shot is

1659
1:07:33,150 --> 1:06:47,320
great  down to surprise

1660
1:07:35,699 --> 1:06:48,940
where the goalkeepers have the hardest time and

1661
1:07:37,319 --> 1:06:51,940
opening up and becoming big the

1662
1:07:38,849 --> 1:06:54,700
german goalkeeper stops her but a

1663
1:07:41,239 --> 1:06:56,080
great opportunity for real madrid and

1664
1:07:43,439 --> 1:06:59,110
hopefully for ter stegen ar goes down

1665
1:07:46,319 --> 1:07:00,700
he leaves dannika

1666
1:07:50,880 --> 1:07:02,770
what has ter stegen done and after  a

1667
1:07:52,980 --> 1:07:05,320
start where real madrid is clearly dominating

1668
1:07:57,240 --> 1:07:07,750
the goalkeeper salvador fc barcelona-

1669
1:07:59,910 --> 1:07:10,270
avoiding

1670
1:08:01,460 --> 1:07:18,570
madrid the appearance was very important

1671
1:08:05,599 --> 1:07:19,300
of the barcelona football goalkeeper right

1672
1:08:09,900 --> 1:07:25,799
now he had once that he was

1673
1:08:12,630 --> 1:07:29,400
winning by much more comfortable than what

1674
1:08:15,210 --> 1:07:31,439
the game he is having

1675
1:08:17,759 --> 1:07:33,150
the ball does not last at all for fc.barcelona we are

1676
1:08:20,100 --> 1:07:35,699
seeing there are nine dead shots from

1677
1:08:21,509 --> 1:07:37,319
real madrid for only one from fc

1678
1:08:23,580 --> 1:07:38,849
barcelona toni kroos give me for benzema

1679
1:08:26,759 --> 1:07:41,239
and that

1680
1:08:28,679 --> 1:07:43,439
gerard piqué

1681
1:08:30,490 --> 1:07:46,319
you want to come out from behind the

1682
1:08:31,660 --> 1:07:50,880
personality of piqué Busquets for leo

1683
1:08:33,580 --> 1:07:52,980
messi there is in that area where he does a lot of

1684
1:08:35,859 --> 1:07:55,259
damage leo messi trains for jordi alba he

1685
1:08:39,310 --> 1:07:57,240
prefers to wait jordi alba because he

1686
1:08:41,589 --> 1:07:59,910
has no chance of deepening

1687
1:08:43,970 --> 1:08:01,460
messi for iniesta  again

1688
1:08:47,100 --> 1:08:05,599
leo messi wants

1689
1:08:50,600 --> 1:08:09,900
to the right for sergi roberto

1690
1:08:52,630 --> 1:08:12,630
he came inside day for

1691
1:08:54,920 --> 1:08:15,210
sergio Busquets he leaves her face for

1692
1:08:56,600 --> 1:08:17,759
want

1693
1:08:58,670 --> 1:08:20,100
and he can't receive the

1694
1:09:03,819 --> 1:08:21,509
fight 10 minutes into the second half in

1695
1:09:06,429 --> 1:08:23,580
which barça is not found if these

1696
1:09:08,649 --> 1:08:26,759
ten  minutes the dominator of the match

1697
1:09:11,469 --> 1:08:28,679
is being real madrid as we have

1698
1:09:13,630 --> 1:08:30,490
commented before when seeing a copy of the

1699
1:09:16,210 --> 1:08:31,660
beginning of the first half and

1700
1:09:18,339 --> 1:08:33,580
barça int again  I have been looking in the opposite field for

1701
1:09:20,139 --> 1:08:35,859
months yes yes no no they have no

1702
1:09:22,899 --> 1:08:39,310
other option

1703
1:09:24,279 --> 1:08:41,589
and the truth is that if I were a member of

1704
1:09:26,229 --> 1:08:43,970
Barça I would be worried as they

1705
1:09:28,180 --> 1:08:47,100
are seeing things

1706
1:09:40,210 --> 1:08:50,600
at the end

1707
1:09:44,250 --> 1:08:52,630
and the right foot now the savior is that of

1708
1:09:47,549 --> 1:08:54,920
killer

1709
1:09:49,540 --> 1:08:56,600
if I know a good opportunity  to be able to

1710
1:09:51,729 --> 1:08:58,670
play it a new one,

1711
1:09:53,830 --> 1:09:03,819
he finds himself with a ball and a control

1712
1:09:56,170 --> 1:09:06,429
to make a definition only

1713
1:10:01,100 --> 1:09:08,649
and in the end I think that I think that he does

1714
1:10:04,000 --> 1:09:11,469
not define well here he does not wait for

1715
1:10:06,760 --> 1:09:13,630
rakitic and with the outside he is not

1716
1:10:10,060 --> 1:09:16,210
capable of putting it in  one side not here that

1717
1:10:12,400 --> 1:09:18,339
lorna you go with him with your foot manages to

1718
1:10:15,700 --> 1:09:20,139
disrupt that play but I think it's

1719
1:10:17,950 --> 1:09:22,899
more of a mistake by the striker if I think that

1720
1:10:19,990 --> 1:09:24,279
here paco alcácer I can do much

1721
1:10:22,000 --> 1:09:26,229
more the closest defender of Real left him a spectacular rakitic ball

1722
1:10:23,440 --> 1:09:28,180
with 34 meters

1723
1:10:27,280 --> 1:09:40,210
madrid makes a

1724
1:10:29,560 --> 1:09:44,250
control that is left with a ball and then

1725
1:10:31,750 --> 1:09:47,549
more than a shot a definition is removed

1726
1:10:34,600 --> 1:09:49,540
from him I think he had

1727
1:10:36,310 --> 1:09:51,729
enough time to

1728
1:10:38,170 --> 1:09:53,830
contact the ball with the inside of his

1729
1:10:39,940 --> 1:09:56,170
leg  right and define so that it would be

1730
1:10:42,010 --> 1:10:01,100
impossible for the navas 30 meters to

1731
1:10:44,080 --> 1:10:04,000
the goal but there is nothing impossible

1732
1:10:45,400 --> 1:10:06,760
for leo messi it was

1733
1:10:50,040 --> 1:10:10,060
and the shot did not escape

1734
1:10:52,020 --> 1:10:12,400
lionel messi goal kick for

1735
1:10:54,630 --> 1:10:15,700
real madrid he knows about the second half

1736
1:10:56,700 --> 1:10:17,950
with the answer  from barça to the clear

1737
1:10:59,490 --> 1:10:19,990
dominance of real madrid in the form of a

1738
1:11:01,950 --> 1:10:22,000
very clear occasion that we see again

1739
1:11:04,590 --> 1:10:23,440
for a short time we see here paco

1740
1:11:06,240 --> 1:10:27,280
alcácer has time to do more

1741
1:11:07,740 --> 1:10:29,560
things i think this occasion is

1742
1:11:09,600 --> 1:10:31,750
unbeatable paco alcácer had you here

1743
1:11:12,000 --> 1:10:34,600
on occasion to unbalance the classic in

1744
1:11:15,000 --> 1:10:36,310
favor  of his team and I see it very difficult for him

1745
1:11:17,970 --> 1:10:38,170
to have an opportunity like the one he

1746
1:11:19,440 --> 1:10:39,940
has had again because he could have another one

1747
1:11:21,530 --> 1:10:42,010
if he found

1748
1:11:28,960 --> 1:10:44,080
it the control of the Uruguayan player was long gone

1749
1:11:33,100 --> 1:10:45,400
a very fast fame that

1750
1:11:35,680 --> 1:10:50,040
barcelona in rome through in the

1751
1:11:37,090 --> 1:10:52,020
center of the  field goes very well and a great

1752
1:11:40,220 --> 1:10:54,630
pass from messi that luis suárez can

1753
1:11:42,080 --> 1:10:56,700
not control well sometimes they

1754
1:11:44,510 --> 1:10:59,490
do spectacular things but they have had

1755
1:11:46,910 --> 1:11:01,950
the opportunity with a simple control of

1756
1:11:49,190 --> 1:11:04,590
stand alone in front of keylor navas

1757
1:11:50,600 --> 1:11:06,240
but if the long cylinder has gone and

1758
1:11:52,970 --> 1:11:07,740
that has allowed the dolón chest to be very

1759
1:11:55,190 --> 1:11:09,600
excited to the classic for loss

1760
1:11:56,900 --> 1:11:12,000
of pumpkin luis suárez in the area

1761
1:11:58,280 --> 1:11:15,000
dribble to luis suárez but that no one go

1762
1:12:00,320 --> 1:11:17,970
cuts about what you look like one wanted

1763
1:12:01,730 --> 1:11:19,440
put luis suárez back

1764
1:12:03,400 --> 1:11:21,530
[Applause]

1765
1:12:07,770 --> 1:11:28,960
for luis enrique's team if

1766
1:12:10,080 --> 1:11:33,100
this is leveling off and here the pass is

1767
1:12:11,610 --> 1:11:35,680
spectacular from messi as a

1768
1:12:13,650 --> 1:11:37,090
colleague of ours would say without control without

1769
1:12:16,740 --> 1:11:40,220
control there is no paradise' here

1770
1:12:19,890 --> 1:11:42,080
that ball to luis suárez that if he had

1771
1:12:21,900 --> 1:11:44,510
controlled  well

1772
1:12:23,090 --> 1:11:46,910
with his left leg he would have

1773
1:12:25,140 --> 1:11:49,190
allowed him to define a one-on-one with

1774
1:12:27,000 --> 1:11:50,600
keylor navas corner kick for

1775
1:12:29,190 --> 1:11:52,970
barça 13 second half he is going to hit

1776
1:12:32,090 --> 1:11:55,190
from the corner ivan rakitic the

1777
1:12:34,860 --> 1:11:56,900
launch of the test

1778
1:12:37,630 --> 1:11:58,280
[Applause]

1779
1:12:46,690 --> 1:12:00,320
three consecutive times

1780
1:12:50,659 --> 1:12:01,730
barça's response

1781
1:12:53,040 --> 1:12:03,400
a real  madrid that has started superior

1782
1:12:55,410 --> 1:12:07,770
that has started having more chances

1783
1:12:57,060 --> 1:12:10,080
but a fc barcelona that the three times

1784
1:13:00,240 --> 1:12:11,610
it has arrived has come with a

1785
1:13:01,620 --> 1:12:13,650
lot of danger  gro, that is, the opportunity to

1786
1:13:04,290 --> 1:12:16,740
have done the 2nd on Saturday kilo nothing or

1787
1:13:06,390 --> 1:12:19,890
a control that no that he has

1788
1:13:08,550 --> 1:12:21,900
not had he had no opportunity to

1789
1:13:10,140 --> 1:12:23,090
materialize the visuals because Rubén has been

1790
1:13:12,210 --> 1:12:25,140
said we were talking three

1791
1:13:14,280 --> 1:12:27,000
minutes ago that Madrid is the real

1792
1:13:16,620 --> 1:12:29,190
dominator of this second part  and in

1793
1:13:19,260 --> 1:12:32,090
three minutes, barça has had three

1794
1:13:20,640 --> 1:12:34,860
chances, two of them very good that

1795
1:13:23,460 --> 1:12:37,630
have not gone

1796
1:13:25,090 --> 1:12:46,690
on goal due

1797
1:13:27,400 --> 1:12:50,659
to keylor navas's very good intervention in both and barça

1798
1:13:29,679 --> 1:12:53,040
is taking

1799
1:13:31,690 --> 1:12:55,410
a step forward toni kroos ball

1800
1:13:34,150 --> 1:12:57,060
for danny carvajal the side joins

1801
1:13:35,530 --> 1:13:00,240
from real madrid

1802
1:13:38,230 --> 1:13:01,620
al was looking for christian ronaldo

1803
1:13:40,960 --> 1:13:04,290
at the near post ter stegen for the

1804
1:13:44,620 --> 1:13:06,390
game has no respite we go from area to

1805
1:13:47,170 --> 1:13:08,550
area here the tremendous jump of pique in

1806
1:13:49,840 --> 1:13:10,140
the fight with christian ronaldo

1807
1:13:52,480 --> 1:13:12,210
if there is between sergio ramos and christian

1808
1:13:53,860 --> 1:13:14,280
ronaldo almost nothing the players have

1809
1:13:56,080 --> 1:13:16,620
I play several games, they are very powerful, but

1810
1:13:58,240 --> 1:13:19,260
because it goes very well to the near post, they mark

1811
1:14:00,550 --> 1:13:20,640
the times very well and the shot is very

1812
1:14:02,860 --> 1:13:23,460
good. Cristiano waits and complains

1813
1:14:05,710 --> 1:13:25,090
because  I think they even

1814
1:14:07,270 --> 1:13:27,400
contacted

1815
1:14:09,099 --> 1:13:29,679
now that

1816
1:14:10,530 --> 1:13:31,690
gerard piqué starts the game day for

1817
1:14:12,580 --> 1:13:34,150
andrés iniesta

1818
1:14:13,530 --> 1:13:35,530
we completed the 15th minute of the second

1819
1:14:15,670 --> 1:13:38,230
half iniesta handles the ball to the

1820
1:14:17,920 --> 1:13:40,960
right for sergi roberto

1821
1:14:19,560 --> 1:13:44,620
crossing the divide sergi roberto

1822
1:14:21,730 --> 1:13:47,170
has on the right iván rakitic we

1823
1:14:24,219 --> 1:13:49,840
see some members of  the benches

1824
1:14:26,920 --> 1:13:52,480
making lost warm-ups

1825
1:14:30,100 --> 1:13:53,860
in the brilliant start from Madrid to

1826
1:14:32,320 --> 1:13:56,080
those 15 minutes

1827
1:14:34,450 --> 1:13:58,240
that he has set a lot of pace and now a

1828
1:14:36,460 --> 1:14:00,550
little bit, well, compensating by taking a breather and

1829
1:14:38,980 --> 1:14:02,860
the barça, because he will have taken advantage of his side

1830
1:14:43,090 --> 1:14:05,710
meters in the opposite field and now he is

1831
1:14:46,300 --> 1:14:07,270
having  plus the position of the ball

1832
1:14:48,739 --> 1:14:09,099
for the ball that managed to get a move

1833
1:14:50,780 --> 1:14:10,530
so that miro first modern touch could

1834
1:14:52,489 --> 1:14:12,580
reach it

1835
1:14:53,700 --> 1:14:13,530
but luka modric returns to get hold of the

1836
1:14:56,220 --> 1:14:15,670
ball danny carvajal short ball

1837
1:14:58,410 --> 1:14:17,920
jordi up passes it to andrés

1838
1:15:00,720 --> 1:14:19,560
iniesta the captain of barça

1839
1:15:02,820 --> 1:14:21,730
rakitic

1840
1:15:03,909 --> 1:14:24,219
is in the circle  central moves

1841
1:15:05,769 --> 1:14:26,920
sergi roberto iván rakitic leaves it

1842
1:15:07,719 --> 1:14:30,100
for iniesta this with sergio bu  squets on

1843
1:15:10,869 --> 1:14:32,320
the left jordi alba gives it to him to

1844
1:15:13,150 --> 1:14:34,450
be Buscats but he is very strong and

1845
1:15:15,939 --> 1:14:36,460
loses the barça that has more ball as

1846
1:15:17,949 --> 1:14:38,980
the label should be a little more than the

1847
1:15:20,380 --> 1:14:43,090
real mother and growing in the game with

1848
1:15:22,630 --> 1:14:46,300
these last five minutes I have

1849
1:15:24,550 --> 1:14:48,739
our  barcelona game with more

1850
1:15:25,989 --> 1:14:50,780
presence is not stealing in the rival field

1851
1:15:28,179 --> 1:14:52,489
stealing the seriousness of real madrid something

1852
1:15:30,760 --> 1:14:53,700
that all day the other way around

1853
1:15:32,450 --> 1:14:56,220
[Applause]

1854
1:15:35,660 --> 1:14:58,410
lamadrid and receives a very usual foul after

1855
1:15:40,530 --> 1:15:00,720
danny carvajal so he understands that

1856
1:15:43,560 --> 1:15:02,820
it was a kick that has  given the

1857
1:15:45,060 --> 1:15:03,909
uruguayan let's

1858
1:15:46,679 --> 1:15:05,769
see if the repetition we see better

1859
1:15:50,369 --> 1:15:07,719
luis suárez vida and carvajal

1860
1:15:53,369 --> 1:15:10,869
protagonists when the game was

1861
1:15:56,399 --> 1:15:13,150
already stopped after the

1862
1:15:59,450 --> 1:15:15,939
no he is going to try to put a little of

1863
1:16:02,190 --> 1:15:17,949
from the discussion between the two and it

1864
1:16:03,960 --> 1:15:20,380
seems that he achieves it

1865
1:16:07,850 --> 1:15:22,630
with

1866
1:16:08,800 --> 1:15:24,550
this of what

1867
1:16:12,020 --> 1:15:25,989
danny carvajal complains and the action of luis

1868
1:16:13,460 --> 1:15:28,179
suárez good fortuitous moves

1869
1:16:15,820 --> 1:15:30,760
[Music]

1870
1:16:19,510 --> 1:15:32,450
well raise the catfish and the existing one

1871
1:16:23,989 --> 1:15:35,660
I don't know if it was really offside

1872
1:16:25,999 --> 1:15:37,610
but it had arrived in e  ste well to the value

1873
1:16:29,160 --> 1:15:40,530
leo messi

1874
1:16:31,309 --> 1:15:43,560
in the dividing line at the beginning for a long time

1875
1:16:34,099 --> 1:15:45,060
this walk is not going to be good short

1876
1:16:36,850 --> 1:15:46,679
let's see what they arrived and carvajal with

1877
1:16:38,770 --> 1:15:50,369
many meters

1878
1:16:41,330 --> 1:15:53,369
one of the key men in recent

1879
1:16:43,340 --> 1:15:56,399
weeks

1880
1:16:44,710 --> 1:15:59,450
could move back

1881
1:16:48,230 --> 1:16:02,190
such on the cut before

1882
1:16:50,840 --> 1:16:03,960
he dedicates himself to throwing  he has a lot of

1883
1:16:52,670 --> 1:16:07,850
freedoms but one against one good

1884
1:16:54,860 --> 1:16:08,800
opponent's area

1885
1:16:56,030 --> 1:16:12,020
it gets complicated there

1886
1:16:57,739 --> 1:16:13,460
the barça players have thrown themselves well on top of him partners

1887
1:17:02,750 --> 1:16:15,820
of cristiano ronaldo

1888
1:17:03,970 --> 1:16:19,510

marshall

1890
1:17:09,050 --> 1:16:25,999
the false ones at the bernabéu that we are

1891
1:17:11,989 --> 1:16:29,160
witnessing today not the

1892
1:17:14,040 --> 1:16:31,309
teams that are demonstrating  his quality

1893
1:17:16,790 --> 1:16:34,099
chances arrived he has to be very

1894
1:17:19,870 --> 1:16:36,850
attentive

1895
1:17:23,020 --> 1:16:38,770
but he is very good

1896
1:17:27,530 --> 1:16:41,330
toni kross he with the near post clears

1897
1:17:30,179 --> 1:16:43,340
luis suárez ball for luka modric

they chase him Sergio Busquets Marcelo

1903

killed cancer nacho's ball  for danny

1905
1:17:52,409 --> 1:17:02,750
carvajal

1906

backs they can surprise and the extra and

1913
1:18:10,540 --> 1:17:23,020
those 45 meters a little further forward

1914
1:18:13,660 --> 1:17:27,530
for when there is that type of ball

1915
1:18:15,640 --> 1:17:30,179
to be able to be like a defender and get well

1916
1:18:18,190 --> 1:17:32,150
to the crossroads or the transfer of Marcelo for very

1917
1:18:20,080 --> 1:17:35,099
difficult so that it would

1918
1:18:22,290 --> 1:17:38,119
be

1919
1:18:23,850 --> 1:17:41,699

1924
1:18:41,330 --> 1:17:53,830

handed over to toni kroos cross who is looking for

1956
1:19:58,679 --> 1:19:15,760

1:20:10,409 --> 1:19:26,490
ah portuguese the ball went down the

1962
1:20:14,420 --> 1:19:30,460
back it was difficult  the auction is very

1963
1:20:17,150 --> 1:19:32,500
difficult very well real madrid is the

1964
1:20:19,970 --> 1:19:34,150
only one that is doing we

1965
1:20:21,590 --> 1:19:38,260
have very good presentations left here looking

1966
1:20:23,570 --> 1:19:40,210
for  scenso and then as there were 12 unemployed

1967
1:20:26,060 --> 1:19:41,610
in the auction area not very equal

1968
1:20:29,270 --> 1:19:44,040
real madrid arrives with two players and

1969
1:20:31,070 --> 1:19:46,440
barcelona defends with two players there

1970
1:20:32,570 --> 1:19:48,420
at any time that they were

1971
1:20:33,950 --> 1:19:50,210
real madrid anticipates

1972
1:20:37,790 --> 1:19:53,790
barça jordi alba's turn on the

1973
1:20:39,710 --> 1:19:55,440
side of the  center area hits is

1974
1:20:41,180 --> 1:19:58,679
nacho you control luka modric modric with

1975
1:20:44,840 --> 1:20:00,090
paco alcácer's mark luka

1976
1:20:47,060 --> 1:20:01,770
modric gets into the wolf's mouth nods

1977
1:20:49,430 --> 1:20:02,869
auditory

1978
1:20:50,920 --> 1:20:06,090
you can sing

1979
1:20:53,460 --> 1:20:10,409
asencio he's going to get tired of the attention he

1980
1:20:55,890 --> 1:20:14,420
puts it for christian who finishes off

1981
1:21:02,060 --> 1:20:17,150
marc the session only  he left with that

1982
1:21:05,420 --> 1:20:19,970
great stride he was generous he handed it over

1983
1:21:08,870 --> 1:20:21,590
to cristiano ronaldo the portuguese lives

1984
1:21:12,600 --> 1:20:23,570
everything in favor of

1985
1:21:14,260 --> 1:20:26,060
the ball over the ball very generous

1986
1:21:17,729 --> 1:20:29,270
because ascension in his career he came

1987
1:21:20,519 --> 1:20:31,070
with a lot of superiority over Busquets

1988
1:21:25,120 --> 1:20:32,570
defined now in one on one with

1989
1:21:26,770 --> 1:20:33,950
having this good  but of course they exist, he

1990
1:21:30,310 --> 1:20:37,790
was there to push on the other side of the

1991
1:21:32,710 --> 1:20:39,710
country and if he stays a little behind and

1992
1:21:34,390 --> 1:20:41,180
forces kristen now he will have to

1993
1:21:35,530 --> 1:20:44,840
jump and the scorer l  uis suárez now

1994
1:21:41,670 --> 1:20:47,060
[Applause]

1995
1:21:44,739 --> 1:20:49,430
here there isn't a second of 3

1996
1:21:46,960 --> 1:20:50,920
[Applause]

1997
1:21:50,739 --> 1:20:53,460
30 seconds

1998
1:21:52,480 --> 1:20:55,890
what a round-trip game of the area

1999
1:21:54,770 --> 1:21:02,060
area of ​​the bernabéu I know who you can't

2000
1:21:56,930 --> 1:21:05,420
pay to comment on a move that there is

2001
1:21:59,690 --> 1:21:08,870
another I think the pass from  iniesta is

2002
1:22:02,150 --> 1:21:12,600
sublime with his outside of his

2003
1:22:04,100 --> 1:21:14,260
right leg and then suárez finishes off well at the

2004
1:22:06,170 --> 1:21:17,729
near post but keylor navas has a

2005
1:22:08,030 --> 1:21:20,519
sensational racket and cannot finish off it

2006
1:22:12,420 --> 1:21:25,120
must be said we have talked about the great

2007
1:22:13,890 --> 1:21:26,770
game of ter stegen but keylor that rakitic

2008
1:22:17,800 --> 1:21:30,310
has had decisive interventions

2009
1:22:20,950 --> 1:21:32,710
in the  opposite side

2010
1:22:22,740 --> 1:21:34,390
[Applause]

2011
1:22:25,090 --> 1:21:35,530
carvajal the one with goat cross but works

2012
1:22:28,420 --> 1:21:41,670
luís suárez gerard piqué leo messi ball

2013
1:22:31,540 --> 1:21:44,739
for sergio Busquets leo messi

2014
1:22:35,300 --> 1:21:46,960
come feel casemiro change his pace

2015
1:22:37,579 --> 1:21:50,739
month and month and he can look for the shot month after month and

2016
1:22:39,260 --> 1:21:52,480
the realmadrid goalkeeper rejected it

2017
1:22:42,810 --> 1:21:54,770
ball for toni kroos  the

2018
1:22:45,480 --> 1:21:56,930
game changer tonic christian

2019
1:22:47,190 --> 1:21:59,690
christian against oriented and

2020
1:22:50,340 --> 1:22:02,150
christian throw-in for barça

2021
1:22:53,930 --> 1:22:04,100
but distributed in the bernabéu

2022
1:22:56,929 --> 1:22:06,170
match could be 44 for me one of

2023
1:23:01,070 --> 1:22:08,030
the best  It's classics that we've seen for a

2024
1:23:02,780 --> 1:22:12,420
long time no chances for both

2025
1:23:05,630 --> 1:22:13,890
teams it's a vibrant game

2026
1:23:06,920 --> 1:22:16,170
exciting at the end football is that it's

2027
1:23:09,530 --> 1:22:17,800
passion it's emotion that's what we're

2028
1:23:11,510 --> 1:22:20,950
living in it in this classic it's

2029
1:23:14,889 --> 1:22:22,740
spectacular we don't care what team

2030
1:23:16,969 --> 1:22:25,090
you are even  that fc barcelona is from madrid

2031
1:23:19,130 --> 1:22:28,420
I think he is

2032
1:23:20,929 --> 1:22:31,540
enjoying this game it is being

2033
1:23:23,539 --> 1:22:35,300
a show a great show

2034
1:23:26,510 --> 1:22:37,579
by barça it is the game that barça is

2035
1:23:28,130 --> 1:22:39,260
interested in they have to win yes or

2036
1:23:29,570 --> 1:22:42,810
yes and they are interested in an open game with

2037
1:23:32,150 --> 1:22:45,480
many chances  and let's see if if he wins

2038
1:23:34,489 --> 1:22:47,190
the game for madrid it's not

2039
1:23:36,979 --> 1:22:50,340
essential to look for the opposite goal,

2040
1:23:38,449 --> 1:22:53,930
maybe he would have to try a

2041
1:23:40,939 --> 1:22:56,929
little more to have the game under control

2042
1:23:42,530 --> 1:23:01,070
because a draw for them is good

2043
1:23:44,239 --> 1:23:02,780
but madrid always looks for the

2044
1:23:47,420 --> 1:23:05,630
opposite goal the book of  the changes

2045
1:23:48,650 --> 1:23:06,920
attention I know if these changes are the

2046
1:23:50,300 --> 1:23:09,530
first surprising or not tiring they saw

2047
1:23:53,210 --> 1:23:11,510
outside they enter like chis web well I think

2048
1:23:55,400 --> 1:23:14,889
that because of the yellow card it is sie  In

2049
1:23:56,870 --> 1:23:16,969
a very intense back-and-forth match

2050
1:23:58,430 --> 1:23:19,130
in any foul you can keep

2051
1:24:00,440 --> 1:23:20,929
one less player, not because

2052
1:24:02,480 --> 1:23:23,539
otherwise they don't see that

2053
1:24:03,800 --> 1:23:26,510
yellow card, they would surely be on the field for

2054
1:24:07,000 --> 1:23:28,130
youngsters because of paco alcácer and luis enrique

2055
1:24:09,130 --> 1:23:29,570
has the options that many

2056
1:24:12,220 --> 1:23:32,150
injuries have  he already decided to remove the cancer and

2057
1:24:16,390 --> 1:23:34,489
rodrigo actions

2058
1:24:19,670 --> 1:23:36,979
my right to the battle kick

2059
1:24:22,050 --> 1:23:38,449
if it could be my suárez andrés gómez he

2060
1:24:25,360 --> 1:23:40,939
preferred between gómez because the defender

2061
1:24:26,889 --> 1:23:42,530
is a player who works a little more

2062
1:24:29,230 --> 1:23:44,239
so he prefers when they don't have

2063
1:24:31,210 --> 1:23:47,420
possession of the ball for being a little bit

2064
1:24:33,159 --> 1:23:48,650
more compact and help on that

2065
1:24:35,530 --> 1:23:50,300
left flank jordi alba that

2066
1:24:38,110 --> 1:23:53,210
carvajal's internships are being very good

2067
1:24:40,150 --> 1:23:55,400
I can tell the players quickly and it

2068
1:24:41,920 --> 1:23:56,870
will be quick for us because here there is no

2069
1:24:43,690 --> 1:23:58,430
truce barça's defense clears ivan

2070
1:24:45,760 --> 1:24:00,440
rakitic for sergio Busquets 25 minutes

2071
1:24:48,730 --> 1:24:02,480
second half

2072
1:24:49,989 --> 1:24:03,800
Busquets  for the event where Messi

2073
1:24:51,900 --> 1:24:07,000
[Applause] we

2074
1:24:53,420 --> 1:24:09,130
closed bands to repeat

2075
1:24:55,550 --> 1:24:12,220
Sergio Busquets at the control to

2076
1:24:57,620 --> 1:24:15,130
arrive very well  n

2077
1:24:59,260 --> 1:24:16,390
and he presses ascension and makes it perfect

2078
1:25:02,409 --> 1:24:19,670

iniesta jordi alba wins andrés gómez

2082
1:25:14,000 --> 1:24:29,230

1:25:15,730 --> 1:24:31,210
started by danny carvajal andrés gómez

2084
1:25:17,440 --> 1:24:33,159
the unit transports nacho adds this

2085
1:25:20,380 --> 1:24:35,530
for luka modric

2086
1:25:22,300 --> 1:24:38,110
modric  starting the game the croatian and

2087
1:25:23,860 --> 1:24:40,150
this luka modric sergio Busquets leaves

2088
1:25:26,290 --> 1:24:41,920
but leo messi

2089
1:25:27,639 --> 1:24:43,690
cleanly takes the ball from him very quickly

2090
1:25:29,940 --> 1:24:45,760

1:25:46,970 --> 1:24:57,620
what you've got now from what

2097
1:25:48,830 --> 1:24:59,260
ter stegen is doing today is

2098
1:25:50,570 --> 1:25:02,409
spectacular he's proving that he

2099
1:25:53,090 --> 1:25:04,199
's one of the best goalkeepers out there

2100
1:25:54,710 --> 1:25:07,960
today,

2101
1:25:55,780 --> 1:25:10,460
not just the league

2102
1:25:58,530 --> 1:25:14,000
the world I don't know what great game

2103
1:26:00,990 --> 1:25:15,730
the soccer goalkeeper franz salvando is doing

2104
1:26:02,670 --> 1:25:17,440
to his team this stop is

2105
1:26:05,750 --> 1:25:20,380
stratospheric not the short stick where

2106
1:26:08,160 --> 1:25:22,300
you do not expect it

2107
1:26:09,380 --> 1:25:23,860
extraordinary from this yes he comments  I laugh

2108
1:26:11,840 --> 1:25:26,290
because he says these words clouds when

2109
1:26:14,060 --> 1:25:27,639
a player with his left leg

2110
1:26:16,430 --> 1:25:29,940
breaks inside 90 of the times he likes

2111
1:26:19,700 --> 1:25:32,440
a definition to the far post with thread

2112
1:26:21,920 --> 1:25:35,520
or young girls or cutters for rack and

2113
1:26:24,410 --> 1:25:37,410
land that is short to throw

2114
1:26:26,210 --> 1:25:43,430
any racket

2115
1:26:28,500 --> 1:25:45,010
here

2116
1:26:34,070 --> 1:25:46,970
huge

2117
1:26:36,520 --> 1:25:48,830
from the front

2118
1:26:40,830 --> 1:25:50,570
in

2119
1:26:44,219 --> 1:25:53,090
In fact, if it were

2120
1:26:48,300 --> 1:25:54,710
Rakitic's santiago de rave howitzer rifle, place in the

2121
1:26:51,150 --> 1:25:55,780
league, change of leader right now

2122
1:26:53,330 --> 1:25:58,530
[Applause]

2123
1:26:55,969 --> 1:26:00,990
everyone, well, what we're talking about gives us time to

2124
1:26:58,880 --> 1:26:02,670
comment on the match, it's being a

2125
1:27:00,769 --> 1:26:05,750
real show, we're talking about the

2126
1:27:02,599 --> 1:26:08,160
ascension song and here  rakitic

2127
1:27:04,760 --> 1:26:09,380
takes a cut from toni kroos great and

2128
1:27:07,340 --> 1:26:11,840
crazy in his less good leg he takes a

2129
1:27:10,280 --> 1:26:14,060
spectacular shot for unstoppable so

2130
1:27:13,190 --> 1:26:16,430
that the navas surprised this 12 because of how he

2131
1:27:16,849 --> 1:26:19,700
was but it was the game that

2132
1:27:18,349 --> 1:26:21,920
barça wanted and now the job is for

2133
1:27:20,269 --> 1:26:24,410
real madrid  and barça is going to be

2134
1:27:21,619 --> 1:26:26,210
intelligent, they are going to open up the field, they are going to

2135
1:27:23,780 --> 1:26:28,500
have to try to have possession of the

2136
1:27:26,239 --> 1:26:34,070
ball and making it endless

2137
1:27:29,110 --> 1:26:36,520
is very difficult for  ra to get the

2138
1:27:31,690 --> 1:26:40,830
position of the ball to real madrid who

2139
1:27:34,030 --> 1:26:44,219
also throws it d

2140
1:27:35,880 --> 1:26:48,300
and there is no they cannot get there but navas

2141
1:27:37,830 --> 1:26:51,150
you put it very well on the opposite side it

2142
1:27:40,400 --> 1:26:53,330
enters at a very good height and good a

2143
1:27:43,070 --> 1:26:55,969
game in which real madrid

2144
1:27:44,390 --> 1:26:58,880
had chances to get

2145
1:27:45,560 --> 1:27:00,769
Ahead of Portugal de Lona has also

2146
1:27:47,300 --> 1:27:02,599
had some very clear chances to see

2147
1:27:49,880 --> 1:27:04,760
that position ahead of the two goalkeepers

2148
1:27:51,380 --> 1:27:07,340
who have done a great job today and

2149
1:27:52,969 --> 1:27:10,280
are having a great game,

2150
1:27:54,520 --> 1:27:13,190
but hey, Barcelona has

2151
1:27:56,989 --> 1:27:16,849
been successful in paying attention to Cristiano,

2152
1:27:59,570 --> 1:27:18,349
it is his turn to respond to  realmadrid corner

2153
1:28:01,820 --> 1:27:20,269
what a crazy game what a show

2154
1:28:03,830 --> 1:27:21,619
we are experiencing in the santiago

2155
1:28:05,570 --> 1:27:23,780
bernabéu and now more than ever barça is

2156
1:28:08,410 --> 1:27:26,239
going to try to sleep the game a bit

2157
1:28:10,060 --> 1:27:29,110
with this 12 andrew gómez's field

2158
1:28:12,730 --> 1:27:31,690
is going to come in handy for barça with iniesta

2159
1:28:14,950 --> 1:27:34,030
with with  andrew gómez with rakitic with Busquets

2160
1:28:18,430 --> 1:27:35,880
and he has a good

2161
1:28:20,530 --> 1:27:37,830
midfield to sustain this result

2162
1:28:22,600 --> 1:27:40,400
to the corner toni kroos clears gerard

2163
1:28:25,270 --> 1:27:43,070
piqué powerful in the center of the ar  ea

2164
1:28:26,740 --> 1:27:44,390
luka modric can look for the shot he

2165
1:28:27,910 --> 1:27:45,560
prefers to change the pace and center

2166
1:28:29,950 --> 1:27:47,300
back clears gerard piqué who

2167
1:28:31,570 --> 1:27:49,880
becomes great in the area

2168
1:28:33,020 --> 1:27:51,380
kick demand for real madrid 29

2169
1:28:35,180 --> 1:27:52,969
minutes 2a

2170
1:28:36,480 --> 1:27:54,520
with this result barça would tie

2171
1:28:38,550 --> 1:27:56,989
points but because of the particular goal average

2172
1:28:40,860 --> 1:27:59,570
they could be the leader  of the championship, yes,

2173
1:28:43,830 --> 1:28:01,820
with one less game to play 0 very

2174
1:28:46,150 --> 1:28:03,830
offside Cristiano very focused

2175
1:28:49,060 --> 1:28:05,570
Cristiano's style

2176
1:28:50,820 --> 1:28:08,410
for you

2177
1:28:53,600 --> 1:28:10,060
for sure because of zero German and I'm

2178
1:28:55,730 --> 1:28:12,730
surprised there that ball look there are many

2179
1:28:58,280 --> 1:28:14,950
players but well there are three

2180
1:28:59,570 --> 1:28:18,430
players clearly offside and  ximo

2181
1:29:02,120 --> 1:28:20,530
wanted the money where is he where is he

2182
1:29:04,040 --> 1:28:22,600
looking the boys are looking at the

2183
1:29:05,630 --> 1:28:25,270
stands because there they are in the form of fire

2184
1:29:07,820 --> 1:28:26,740
two meters no it is not that there is a doubt they are

2185
1:29:11,240 --> 1:28:27,910
two meters and three real

2186
1:29:13,070 --> 1:28:29,950
madrid players which one or messi leo messi wants to

2187
1:29:15,950 --> 1:28:31,570
leave marcelo surrender  for toni kross the

2188
1:29:18,560 --> 1:28:33,020
mind to die what a wonder i have

2189
1:29:19,940 --> 1:28:35,180
done it luka modric

2190
1:29:22,980 --> 1:28:36,480
asensio driving huge cut by

2191
1:29:26,670 --> 1:28:38,550
sergio Busquets here is the 5 of

2192
1:29:29,970 --> 1:28:40,860
barça enter  ega search hitting the ball for

2193
1:29:31,770 --> 1:28:43,830
ivan rakitic he is playing with leo messi

2194
1:29:34,370 --> 1:28:46,150
short marcelo there is barceló delivery

2195
1:29:37,020 --> 1:28:49,060
for toni kroos the drop shot for mateo

2196
1:29:38,670 --> 1:28:50,820
kovacic

2197
1:29:39,340 --> 1:28:53,600
comes to receive luka modric let's not forget

2198
1:29:42,040 --> 1:28:55,730
that real madrid has already made two

2199
1:29:44,230 --> 1:28:58,280
changes and i think the third change

2200
1:29:46,659 --> 1:28:59,570
if this continues like this it will be and he will remove

2201
1:29:49,510 --> 1:29:02,120
a midfield player and he will have

2202
1:29:52,330 --> 1:29:04,040
to risk a little more or even

2203
1:29:54,820 --> 1:29:05,630
karim but I think the team

2204
1:29:55,989 --> 1:29:07,820
needs and between the lines a player like a

2205
1:29:57,909 --> 1:29:11,240
puck who after that is to free the

2206
1:30:00,570 --> 1:29:13,070
game to put him in  a 2 to 2 and I think

2207
1:30:04,570 --> 1:29:15,950
it won't take long for the city to

2208
1:30:06,070 --> 1:29:18,560
incorporate it into the field of play, well,

2209
1:30:07,900 --> 1:29:19,940
maybe it will also be purple, also the offensive power

2210
1:30:09,699 --> 1:29:22,980
in the midfield,

2211
1:30:11,809 --> 1:29:26,670
both Madrid and the nation's chronicle,

2212
1:30:15,040 --> 1:29:29,970
we'll see if he said to do it, he has

2213
1:30:17,800 --> 1:29:31,770
those options, he has here, month and  be

2214
1:30:19,690 --> 1:29:34,370
careful because lucas vázquez is not even on the

2215
1:30:21,640 --> 1:29:37,020
squad list off the bench

2216
1:30:24,220 --> 1:29:38,670
and the

2217
1:30:25,780 --> 1:29:39,340
ball guard for sergio ramos- 31 minutes you

2218
1:30:28,060 --> 1:29:42,040
can talk about delivery ramos

2219
1:30:29,800 --> 1:29:44,230
for barceló

2220
1:30:32,240 --> 1:29:46,659
garcía  rgio ramos hands him

2221
1:30:35,660 --> 1:29:49,510
on the right for hook nacho

2222
1:30:38,870 --> 1:29:52,330
long ball mega the ball and luís suárez

2223
1:30:40,630 --> 1:29:54,820
suárez who wanted to roll goes to

2224
1:30:42,980 --> 1:29:55,989
the sideline serve for real madrid the

2225
1:30:45,380 --> 1:29:57,909
glass retracts a little sergio ramos

2226
1:30:48,560 --> 1:30:00,570
yes barça did their job and  there are 15

2227
1:30:51,200 --> 1:30:04,570
minutes left and it is clear that I am not

2228
1:30:52,550 --> 1:30:06,070
going to make a counterattack they are going to try to find

2229
1:30:53,930 --> 1:30:07,900
luis suárez m yes but as long as they

2230
1:30:56,240 --> 1:30:09,699
keep their goal well karim benzema benzema is

2231
1:30:57,980 --> 1:30:11,809
on his face they got fed up benzema the

2232
1:30:59,450 --> 1:30:15,040
short cop gerard piqué the ball is going to

2233
1:31:01,880 --> 1:30:17,800
chase it toni kross but he goes  to get there

2234
1:31:03,140 --> 1:30:19,690
leo messi messi went to the entrance

2235
1:31:05,660 --> 1:30:21,640
of sergio ramos it's going to cost you 1

2236
1:31:08,650 --> 1:30:24,220
clear

2237
1:31:10,410 --> 1:30:25,780
red cardboard to do how weird

2238
1:31:13,000 --> 1:30:28,060
[Applause]

2239
1:31:19,739 --> 1:30:29,800
we are that it was going to be yellow but

2240
1:31:23,350 --> 1:30:32,240
repetition we'll see what they make

2241
1:31:26,890 --> 1:30:35,660
eternal of the fact to think that the

2242
1:31:29,260 --> 1:30:38,870
entrance is to steal if we go to the

2243
1:31:31,990 --> 1:30:40,630
repetition to give a little better opinion

2244
1:31:34,180 --> 1:30:42,980
for me yes that play that cuts the

2245
1:31:37,390 --> 1:30:45,380
counterattack and is a foul and for my

2246
1:31:40,000 --> 1:30:48,560
yellow card but let's see

2247
1:31:46,829 --> 1:30:51,200
if with that he wants  to say that his

2248
1:31:48,329 --> 1:30:52,550
protests I

2249
1:31:49,320 --> 1:30:53,930
don't believe him that it

2250
1:31:52,080 --> 1:30:56,240
is not true that Donostia attacked from the

2251
1:31:53,910 --> 1:30:57,980
front but it is not his turn I think it is

2252
1:31:55,830 --> 1:30:59,450
a very clear yellow card

2253
1:31:58,170 --> 1:31:01,880
from Sergio Ramos because he cuts against the

2254
1:31:59,760 --> 1:31:03,140
attack but he cannot break up the

2255
1:32:01,980 --> 1:31:05,660
game like that inside we are watching  a

2256
1:32:03,480 --> 1:31:08,650
great game

2257
1:32:06,030 --> 1:31:10,410
a team with one less player is a

2258
1:32:08,920 --> 1:31:13,000
very big responsibility no I don't think

2259
1:32:10,360 --> 1:31:19,739
that they take the referee there

2260
1:32:12,560 --> 1:31:23,350
yes I think we have seen the repetition

2261
1:32:14,150 --> 1:31:26,890
the truth is that the entrance is very strong and

2262
1:32:16,460 --> 1:31:29,260
here we select the plant piquer

2263
1:32:18,140 --> 1:31:31,990
all their

2264
1:32:19,750 --> 1:31:34,180
protests

2265
1:32:21,090 --> 1:31:37,390
[Music  ]

2266
1:32:23,039 --> 1:31:40,000
they are asking him now in his favor and

2267
1:32:26,619 --> 1:31:46,829
now he tells him well why he doesn't speak

2268
1:32:28,150 --> 1:31:48,329
now I think if we bury him with all

2269
1:32:30,550 --> 1:31:49,320
his reason because for me I'll say it again it's a

2270
1:32:32,380 --> 1:31:52,080
foul and for me it's a card but

2271
1:32:35,199 --> 1:31:53,910
it's not red well two friends like

2272
1:32:37,840 --> 1:31:55,830
sergio ramos and gerard piqué recognized

2273
1:32:40,540 --> 1:31:58,170
or at least that is what they saw he

2274
1:32:42,340 --> 1:31:59,760
says they are

2275
1:32:43,480 --> 1:32:01,980
facing each other right now

2276
1:32:46,420 --> 1:32:03,480
today we are going to see in these minutes hour 12

2277
1:32:49,300 --> 1:32:06,030
to the end the real one well

2278
1:32:53,250 --> 1:32:08,920
how is he capable of structuring  and

2279
1:32:57,230 --> 1:32:10,360
in these minutes you can now read the one about

2280
1:32:59,330 --> 1:32:12,560
mateo kovacic bringing

2281
1:33:02,880 --> 1:32:14,150
the true santiago story on fire

2282
1:33:08,140 --> 1:32:16,460
[Applause]

2283
1:33:11,460 --> 1:32:18,140
good yellow card

2284
1:33:13,900 --> 1:32:19,750
[Applause]

2285
1:33:15,500 --> 1:32:21,090
well a very nice game we were

2286
1:33:17,840 --> 1:32:23,039
watching an exciting game he

2287
1:33:20,080 --> 1:32:26,619
is ahead of trying to tie a very

2288
1:33:24,280 --> 1:32:28,150
important game and there the referee  from the

2289
1:33:26,870 --> 1:32:30,550
hub to real madrid with 1 - when it

2290
1:33:28,340 --> 1:32:32,380
shouldn't be if it's a red for the game and

2291
1:33:31,190 --> 1:32:35,199
a direct red card

2292
1:33:34,100 --> 1:32:37,840
how many games with the decisions

2293
1:33:36,050 --> 1:32:40,540
that real madrid have from maranello

2294
1:33:37,840 --> 1:32:42,340
[Applause]

2295
1:33:39,720 --> 1:32:43,480
and we're going to see how to fix that

2296
1:33:42,060 --> 1:32:46,420
defensive line now in these last  minutes

2297
1:33:43,680 --> 1:32:49,300
like that, they are going to have to

2298
1:33:45,300 --> 1:32:53,250
multiply in defense, get involved a

2299
1:33:47,010 --> 1:32:57,230
little with nacho and in attack to try to

2300
1:33:48,600 --> 1:32:59,330
help the midfield, barça is going to

2301
1:33:50,940 --> 1:33:02,880
try to put the game to sleep and make it

2302
1:33:53,340 --> 1:33:08,140
attract

2303
1:33:55,720 --> 1:33:11,460
[Applause]

2304
1:34:07,480 --> 1:33:13,900
impossible

2305
1:34:08,540 --> 1:33:15,500
[Applause]

2306
1:34:14,670 --> 1:33:17,840
from keylor navas ways I have  forgiven, I

2307
1:34:17,250 --> 1:33:20,080
think it was a save by keylor

2308
1:34:18,840 --> 1:33:23,110
navas as the girl came out with space

2309
1:34:21,330 --> 1:33:24,280
and avoided in the

2310
1:34:24,340 --> 1:33:26,870
third match of the cri cri Democrat party

2311
1:34:27,130 --> 1:33:28,340
christian

2312
1:34:32,220 --> 1:33:31,190
stiano goal kick asked for the

2313
1:34:35,070 --> 1:33:34,100
christian and the one who is going to put the city

2314
1:34:37,190 --> 1:33:36,050
you did not eat bruise

2315
1:34:39,170 --> 1:33:37,840
good player also before I wanted to

2316
1:34:41,300 --> 1:33:39,720
say the occasion is piketty who could

2317
1:34:42,890 --> 1:33:42,060
have sentenced the game and there was a

2318
1:34:48,010 --> 1:33:43,680
clear lack of the chet and in this

2319
1:34:51,739 --> 1:33:45,300
case the  yellow card to deal with right

2320
1:34:55,340 --> 1:33:47,010
now the game is at a point

2321
1:34:59,060 --> 1:33:48,600
where this is boiling

2322
1:35:01,040 --> 1:33:50,940
if madrid has to risk

2323
1:35:03,690 --> 1:33:53,340
for my very clear foul by jacobacci che

2324
1:35:06,780 --> 1:33:55,720
but well done for his team it is

2325
1:35:08,910 --> 1:34:07,480
also a very clear yellow card

2326
1:35:10,560 --> 1:34:08,540
because for a counterattack but

2327
1:35:13,110 --> 1:34:14,670
if it does come  to go to cobach and they

2328
1:35:14,280 --> 1:34:17,250
considered a three against one and it was

2329
1:35:16,260 --> 1:34:18,840
barça's third goal for sure

2330
1:35:20,099 --> 1:34:21,330
and here the

2331
1:35:21,599 --> 1:34:24,340
referee made a mistake again because it was a corner in favor of

2332
1:35:23,699 --> 1:34:27,130
real madrid who did not concede a

2333
1:35:25,650 --> 1:34:32,220
shot from Cristiano but

2334
1:35:27,750 --> 1:34:35,070
gerard piqué's leg

2335
1:35:28,520 --> 1:34:37,190
[  Applause]

2336
1:35:31,180 --> 1:34:39,170
when jaime rodríguez has already entered

2337
1:35:33,970 --> 1:34:41,300
karim benzema has left the field of

2338
1:35:36,490 --> 1:34:42,890
play

2339
1:35:37,849 --> 1:34:45,320
iniesta leaves javier iniesta with

2340
1:35:41,599 --> 1:34:48,010
the ball enters cesc  iniesta for luis

2341
1:35:43,189 --> 1:34:51,739
suárez hits iniesta himself kovacic

2342
1:35:45,829 --> 1:34:55,340
recovers let's see real madrid which

2343
1:35:48,590 --> 1:34:57,920
is a team with 10 even the heroic

2344
1:35:51,189 --> 1:34:59,060
is not the first time he has bounced games

2345
1:35:54,459 --> 1:35:01,040
gerard piqué heads but devaluation

2346
1:35:56,689 --> 1:35:03,690
that he looks for is very smart or sergio

2347
1:35:58,609 --> 1:35:06,780
Busquets letting pass  the ball

2348
1:36:00,250 --> 1:35:08,910
[Applause]

2349
1:36:01,900 --> 1:35:10,560
beautiful that was produced by luka modric

2350
1:36:04,040 --> 1:35:13,110
if that's why nothing is going to put the game to sleep

2351
1:36:06,890 --> 1:35:14,280
without any hurry in that he is a

2352
1:36:09,410 --> 1:35:16,260
real teacher he knew that madrid was

2353
1:36:11,300 --> 1:35:20,099
going to put pressure on him and that he was going to put that

2354
1:36:13,940 --> 1:35:21,599
burden on him and that's why  he lets the ball pass so

2355
1:36:16,340 --> 1:35:23,699
that the two collide and a foul caused very well

2356
1:36:18,320 --> 1:35:25,650
by Busquets leo

2357
1:36:20,060 --> 1:35:27,750
messi leaves he does what he wants

2358
1:36:23,730 --> 1:35:28,520
[Applause]

2359
1:36:27,300 --> 1:35:31,180
the value that can be lost by the

2360
1:36:28,889 --> 1:35:33,970
blanket is going to be protected by ivan rakitic touches

2361
1:36:30,869 --> 1:35:36,490
marcelo

2362
1:36:33,500 --> 1:35:37,849
where the argentinian does not  It's normal, I think

2363
1:36:35,990 --> 1:35:41,599
it's impossible to stop any

2364
1:36:38,420 --> 1:35:43,189
player, he makes it clear, whatever

2365
1:36:40,640 --> 1:35:45,829
name he has, but it's not there, it's

2366
1:36:42,830 --> 1:35:48,590
Toni Kroos, he's a world champion player,

2367
1:36:44,390 --> 1:35:51,189
meat from Europe, but when he turns he's

2368
1:36:46,730 --> 1:35:54,459
unstoppable and p  for me it is not impossible

2369
1:36:49,160 --> 1:35:56,689
with one on one for the missive

2370
1:36:51,700 --> 1:35:58,609
kovacic kovacic against his own

2371
1:36:54,550 --> 1:36:00,250
goal and I will end up winning

2372
1:36:57,909 --> 1:36:01,900
a spectacular two-meter sprint

2373
1:37:01,209 --> 1:36:04,040
and he always waits as

2374
1:37:04,269 --> 1:36:06,890
long as possible for the time possible to make his snatch

2375
1:37:06,400 --> 1:36:09,410
so he does not allow the

2376
1:37:09,320 --> 1:36:11,300
rival to maneuver  no and that is where he

2377
1:37:11,600 --> 1:36:13,940
is much superior he

2378
1:37:13,469 --> 1:36:16,340
is like that player who attracts not that he

2379
1:37:16,349 --> 1:36:18,320
waits for the moment when he is disgusted by races to

2380
1:37:18,929 --> 1:36:20,060
rip me off he knows that in 23 meters he is

2381
1:37:21,449 --> 1:36:23,730
superior to any player and he

2382
1:37:24,030 --> 1:36:27,300
waits until the last moment to

2383
1:37:25,590 --> 1:36:28,889
decide very quickly he changes  the

2384
1:37:27,989 --> 1:36:30,869
address and there the rival is

2385
1:37:30,510 --> 1:36:33,500
dead no no he can't do anything

2386
1:37:31,889 --> 1:36:35,990
because here we go tremendously superior

2387
1:37:34,139 --> 1:36:38,420
foul in favor of barça ivan rakitic is going to put it

2388
1:37:36,329 --> 1:36:40,640
ivan rakitic takes out the ball at the

2389
1:37:38,969 --> 1:36:42,830
far post fill the pickaxe he touches

2390
1:37:40,499 --> 1:36:44,390
a marmoset with his head and the fight can break out

2391
1:37:42,630 --> 1:36:46,730
the real madrid counter presses the

2392
1:37:43,949 --> 1:36:49,160
concession bar for christians they leave

2393
1:37:46,019 --> 1:36:51,700
the white team and christian integrates

2394
1:37:48,239 --> 1:36:54,550
for marcelo

2395
1:37:49,920 --> 1:36:57,909
looking on the counter side  rio

2396
1:37:52,980 --> 1:37:01,209
cafetero before andrew gómez

2397
1:37:55,440 --> 1:37:04,269
james leaves it for the incorporation of

2398
1:37:57,330 --> 1:37:06,400
danny carvajal he is at the front of the

2399
1:37:59,460 --> 1:37:09,320
area carvajal hands over to haven james

2400
1:38:01,410 --> 1:37:11,600
who can put together the potential shot

2401
1:38:04,280 --> 1:37:13,469
block der spiegel

2402
1:38:07,309 --> 1:37:16,349
because it was very far but he has an

2403
1:38:09,530 --> 1:37:18,929
exquisite left leg and

2404
1:38:11,539 --> 1:37:21,449
I even think they touch some  barça game

2405
1:38:13,519 --> 1:37:24,030
that could be seen we see there they play a marmoset and it

2406
1:38:15,800 --> 1:37:25,590
could have surprised ter stegen

2407
1:38:18,109 --> 1:37:27,989
but luckily it went to the hands he

2408
1:38:20,749 --> 1:37:30,510
stole fc.barcelona sergi roberto delay to

2409
1:38:22,879 --> 1:37:31,889
the goal

2410
1:38:24,540 --> 1:37:34,139
39 minutes in the santiago bernabéu stadium

2411
1:38:28,260 --> 1:37:36,329
and right now with this  12 turns

2412
1:38:30,900 --> 1:37:38,969
red hot real madrid wants to

2413
1:38:32,369 --> 1:37:40,499
avoid it in the remaining minutes jordi

2414
1:38:35,250 --> 1:37:42,630
alba hands over to andrew gómez the

2415
1:38:38,010 --> 1:37:43,949
added error luka modric steals from me let's see

2416
1:38:39,929 --> 1:37:46,019
who knows what the referee is

2417
1:38:41,429 --> 1:37:48,239
for real madrid

2418
1:38:43,060 --> 1:37:49,920
to get danny out  carvajal

2419
1:38:45,240 --> 1:37:52,980
delivers for javier rodríguez receives

2420
1:38:47,590 --> 1:37:55,440
toni kroos but turns to mateo

2421
1:38:50,680 --> 1:37:57,330
kovacic

2422
1:38:52,360 --> 1:37:59,460
the croatian starting the game

2423
1:38:54,280 --> 1:38:01,410
casemiro's substitute who now

2424
1:38:56,770 --> 1:38:04,280
has to be c  asemiro and ramos in one

2425
1:38:58,840 --> 1:38:07,309
and the one from madrid has to be very

2426
1:39:00,700 --> 1:38:09,530
specific in the passes because we see that

2427
1:39:02,170 --> 1:38:11,539
behind kovacic dryness

2428
1:39:04,650 --> 1:38:13,519
with nacho and above me and

2429
1:39:08,260 --> 1:38:15,800
luis suárez stay and they will find how to

2430
1:39:09,700 --> 1:38:18,109
get the value in hand to hand like

2431
1:39:11,170 --> 1:38:20,749
marcelo  marcelo

2432
1:39:15,260 --> 1:38:22,879
[Applause]

2433
1:39:23,250 --> 1:38:24,540
[Applause]

2434
1:39:26,139 --> 1:38:27,240
to the Colombian

2435
1:39:28,370 --> 1:38:28,260
5

2436
1:39:30,210 --> 1:38:30,900
I see that it had an effect

2437
1:39:34,030 --> 1:38:32,369
for the

2438
1:39:37,590 --> 1:38:35,250
near post of gaulle to say for the championship

2439
1:39:43,559 --> 1:38:38,010
if kevin enters this, it changes for the

2440
1:39:46,659 --> 1:38:39,929
hand the same a draw and a defeat to

2441
1:39:49,300 --> 1:38:41,429
cut the points and how jaimes enters

2442
1:39:51,610 --> 1:38:43,060
from  back looking for space looking for

2443
1:39:53,710 --> 1:38:45,240
the near post here we see how the

2444
1:39:54,880 --> 1:38:47,590
entire area is crossed the entire area is crossed

2445
1:39:57,429 --> 1:38:50,680
to receive that value at the near post it

2446
1:39:59,409 --> 1:38:52,360
is the only one that ter stegen has not been able to

2447
1:40:01,690 --> 1:38:54,280
do anything it was a very close shot very

2448
1:40:03,699 --> 1:38:56,770
accurate from hammer  that puts the tie

2449
1:40:06,190 --> 1:38:58,840
on the scoreboard there let's see how

2450
1:40:07,929 --> 1:39:00,700
his right hand tries to get them out

2451
1:40:10,570 --> 1:39:02,170
but you can't ask the goalkeeper for more and

2452
1:40:13,179 --> 1:39:04,650
I've said it before his speed has

2453
1:40:14,889 --> 1:39:08,260
nothing to envy luis enrique luis

2454
1:40:16,270 --> 1:39:09,700
enrique no  he has nothing to send to

2455
1:40:17,980 --> 1:39:11,170
zidane only in one thing on the bench

2456
1:40:20,290 --> 1:39:15,260
that has zidane he has a

2457
1:40:22,389 --> 1:39:23,250
spectacular bench with asensio with isco with him

2458
1:40:25,420 --> 1:39:26,139
now with jaime rodríguez and that those

2459
1:40:27,579 --> 1:39:28,370
options nowadays barça for

2460
1:40:29,980 --> 1:39:30,210
different reasons the game does not have them

2461
1:40:32,320 --> 1:39:34,030
two by two

2462
1:40:34,460 --> 1:39:37,590
and they are going to try to sleep the match for

2463
1:40:37,400 --> 1:39:43,559
them this result is good and barça

2464
1:40:39,710 --> 1:39:46,659
has to look very carefully be

2465
1:40:41,600 --> 1:39:49,300
careful what the charge is going to madrid

2466
1:40:44,199 --> 1:39:51,610
if the driving

2467
1:40:45,450 --> 1:39:53,710
bases and now he faces power throwing

2468
1:40:47,070 --> 1:39:54,880
sea consensus he wants to let

2469
1:40:48,780 --> 1:39:57,429

2471
1:40:52,760 --> 1:40:01,690
[Applause]

2472
1:40:58,710 --> 1:40:03,699
for the victory

2473
1:41:01,610 --> 1:40:06,190
and

2474
1:41:03,320 --> 1:40:07,929
lack of leo over the german player

2475
1:41:07,619 --> 1:40:10,570
in these minutes we will surely see some

2476
1:41:10,469 --> 1:40:13,179
chance of the game that

2477
1:41:11,939 --> 1:40:14,889
barcelona will see some chance of

2478
1:41:13,829 --> 1:40:16,270
real madrid to take the match the

2479
1:41:16,679 --> 1:40:17,980
offside of  you know when you go with

2480
1:41:19,079 --> 1:40:20,290
this inertia you can't stop the rhythm it's

2481
1:41:21,329 --> 1:40:22,389
that with so few minutes left you carry

2482
1:41:23,459 --> 1:40:25,420
an energy back and forth in which

2483
1:41:24,959 --> 1:40:27,579
you  he two teams want to seek

2484
1:41:26,070 --> 1:40:29,980
victory it is very difficult to have to stop

2485
1:41:28,320 --> 1:40:32,320
it is not true that the draw

2486
1:41:30,479 --> 1:40:34,460
benefits real madrid but I think it will be

2487
1:41:32,249 --> 1:40:37,400
very difficult for this energy of the

2488
1:41:34,110 --> 1:40:39,710
match if rubén is absolutely right

2489
1:41:37,610 --> 1:40:41,600
we are talking about barça and  real madrid

2490
1:41:39,650 --> 1:40:44,199
two teams regardless of the points they

2491
1:41:41,930 --> 1:40:45,450
have even if they are in madrid with one

2492
1:41:43,460 --> 1:40:47,070
less player they always look for the

2493
1:41:45,830 --> 1:40:48,780
opposite goal I think today we are seeing a

2494
1:41:48,140 --> 1:40:50,640
real spectacle of two teams with

2495
1:41:50,990 --> 1:40:52,760
an incredible level I think

2496
1:41:52,820 --> 1:40:58,710
that we will have seen 20 chances

2497
1:41:56,340 --> 1:41:01,610
for both of us in the match  teams and the truth is that the people

2498
1:41:58,170 --> 1:41:03,320
who are in the stadium the people who

2499
1:41:59,730 --> 1:41:07,619

2500
1:42:01,620 --> 1:41:10,469

1:42:03,000 --> 1:41:11,939
enjoying a show

2502
1:42:05,090 --> 1:41:13,829

2503
1:42:07,640 --> 1:41:16,679

caracolea is holding it he leaves it for jaimes

2512

jaimes puts it looking for bar

smooth for sergi roberto andrés iniesta

2519
1:42:51,660 --> 1:41:50,990
we seek to be a place that contributes toni

kroos for the players they are dead

2521
1:42:55,930 --> 1:41:56,340
the level is has been of incredible intensity

2522
1:42:57,820 --> 1:41:58,170
and now on top of that in these

2523
1:43:00,550 --> 1:41:59,730
last few minutes back and forth because on the

2524
1:43:02,830 --> 1:42:01,620
part of madrid Ciencia and jaime only

2525
1:43:05,110 --> 1:42:03,000
he can defend he's going to go to the bottom

2526
1:43:09,050 --> 1:42:05,090
[Applause]

2527
1:43:10,470 --> 1:42:07,640
with

2528
1:43:13,340 --> 1:42:10,050
Cristiano above

2529
1:43:15,380 --> 1:42:13,230
Portuguese he goes outside

2530
1:43:18,620 --> 1:42:16,590
what a panicked effort of the players of

2531
1:43:21,670 --> 1:42:19,800
the protagonists it's

2532
1:43:23,969 --> 1:42:22,110
true that the player who has the most

2533
1:43:26,559 --> 1:42:23,780
freshness to it on the field is he is

2534
1:43:28,480 --> 1:42:26,119
asensio he doesn't know to be true that  he has just

2535
1:43:30,429 --> 1:42:28,440
entered he is much fresher but he does not

2536
1:43:31,840 --> 1:42:30,690
have the speed to win the back of

2537
1:43:34,150 --> 1:42:33,590
fire and barcelona not here yes asensio is

2538
1:43:36,670 --> 1:42:38,239
capable with his power and above all that

2539
1:43:38,920 --> 1:42:41,710
he is a little fresher than the

2540
1:43:39,909 --> 1:42:44,200
defense because barcelona must be able to

2541
1:43:41,289 --> 1:42:46,620
face and be able to generate the chance

2542
1:43:43,480 --> 1:42:48,580
that allows real madrid that game

2543
1:43:45,429 --> 1:42:51,660
sergio

2544
1:43:48,480 --> 1:42:54,010
Busquets barça needs to win the game if not

2545
1:43:50,910 --> 1:42:55,930
the league will make it very difficult

2546
1:43:52,680 --> 1:42:57,820
for Busquets very strong ball and  the transfer of

2547
1:43:55,530 --> 1:43:00,550
marcelo

2548
1:43:57,179 --> 1:43:02,830
keylor navas

2549
1:43:59,460 --> 1:43:05,110
but indeed you are beginning to perceive

2550
1:44:02,660 --> 1:43:09,050
symptoms of great fatigue in some

2551
1:44:05,460 --> 1:43:10,470
footballers

2552
1:44:07,240 --> 1:43:13,340
there is even leo messi himself- take

2553
1:44:10,030 --> 1:43:15,380
a little breath let's see the

2554
1:44:13,300 --> 1:43:18,620
added time blow to keylor christian

2555
1:44:15,970 --> 1:43:21,670
ronaldo heads the ball for ter stegen

2556
1:44:18,810 --> 1:43:23,969
plays  gerard piqué let's see how much time

2557
1:44:21,730 --> 1:43:26,559
hernández fernando adds because only two

2558
1:44:25,530 --> 1:43:28,480
minutes more than time is going to be played

2559
1:44:28,590 --> 1:43:30,429
sergi roberto steal point mateo

2560
1:44:31,260 --> 1:43:31,840
kovacic stick for gerard piqué

2561
1:44:34,659 --> 1:43:34,150
for andrés iniesta

2562
1:44:36,680 --> 1:43:36,670
iniesta entered from the left

2563
1:44:38,240 --> 1:43:38,920
before and distant luka modric iniesta

2564
1:44:40,580 --> 1:43:39,909
for  jordi alba alba centered towards luis

2565
1:44:43,190 --> 1:43:41,289

2566
1:44:46,349 --> 1:43:43,480
let's see if he has a way out to real

2567
1:44:47,939 --> 1:43:45,429
madrid jaime cuts himself and shut up I'll have

2568
1:44:49,919 --> 1:43:48,480
gomes f  high in favor of real

2569
1:44:54,400 --> 1:43:50,910
madrid time is wasting at the bernabéu at the

2570
1:44:57,580 --> 1:43:52,680
moment tables that would leave the league

2571
1:45:00,850 --> 1:43:55,530
with three points more than madrid with one

2572
1:45:02,860 --> 1:43:57,179
game less and with it they will return by the

2573
1:45:05,500 --> 1:43:59,460
way even between the two teams

2574
1:45:09,130 --> 1:44:02,660
this is the goal that can be worth a

2575
1:45:12,220 --> 1:44:05,460
javier rodríguez league

2576
1:45:15,619 --> 1:44:07,240

2577
1:45:18,199 --> 1:44:10,030
important goal very

2578
1:45:20,260 --> 1:44:13,300
important above all for continuing to

2579
1:45:22,280 --> 1:44:15,970
maintain that income with the game for

2580
1:45:23,659 --> 1:44:18,810
barcelona and with so few

2581
1:45:26,179 --> 1:44:21,730

anyone thought that it was not a

2586
1:45:38,780 --> 1:44:34,659
successful change because

to follow bértoa and in that action mode he

2611
1:46:50,710 --> 1:45:36,919
tries but badly

2612
1:46:52,760 --> 1:45:38,780
but he doesn't want marcelo he has to shoot

2613
1:46:54,560 --> 1:45:44,090
sergio to site  roberto and not giving him the

2614
1:46:56,360 --> 1:45:45,650
opportunity to make that counterattack

2615
1:46:58,890 --> 1:45:47,890
jordi alba by bands getting behind

2616
1:47:01,330 --> 1:45:49,420

2640
1:48:08,340 --> 1:46:56,360

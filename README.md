# SoccerHighlight Project

Welcome to the Soccer Highlight project! This machine learning algorithm is designed to automatically capture highlight segments from sports game clips using PyTorch. By analyzing audio spikes and detecting changes in the scoreboard, our algorithm identifies key moments such as soccer goals or basketball three-pointers, making it easier for creators and fans to relive the excitement of the game.

## Features

- **Audio Spike Detection**: Identifies moments of high excitement by analyzing the audio track for spikes, often indicative of a crowd's reaction to a significant play.
- **Scoreboard Change Detection**: Uses machine learning to recognize changes in the scoreboard, confirming the occurrence of events like goals or points.
- **PyTorch Framework**: Built with PyTorch, ensuring efficient and effective model training and execution.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows for the adjustment of sensitivity for audio and visual detections, making it versatile for various types of sports and video quality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.4+
- FFmpeg for processing video files
- A basic understanding of machine learning concepts

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Soccer-Highlights.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages.
   
   ```sh
   cd Soccer-Highlights
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start capturing highlights from your game clips, simply run the main script with the path to your video file:

```sh
python HighlightClip.py --input path/to/your/video.mp4
```

The script will process the video, identifying and extracting highlights based on audio spikes and scoreboard changes. The output will be a compilation of highlight segments saved to your specified directory.
